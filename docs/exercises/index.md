These exercises are provided to give the student the opportunity to do focused exercises on a particular topic.

When applicable, exercises are broken up into "Level 1," "Level 2," and "Level 3" according to their respective difficulty levels<br/> (_with the occassional "Level 9000"_ :grinning:).

In many cases there are solutions provided. However, these are examples of _possible_ solutions. It is entirely possible, and likely, that your solution will look slightly different. Use the solutions as a guide to check _your_ work.
