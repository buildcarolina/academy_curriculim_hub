These exercises are provided to give the student the opportunity to do focused exercises on a particular topic.

When applicable, exercises are broken up into "Small," "Medium," and "Large" according to their respective difficulty levels.

In many cases there are solutions provided. However, these are examples of _possible_ solutions. It is entirely possible, and likely, that your solution will look slightly different. Use the solutions as a guide to check _your_ work.
