Use these exercises to practice working with conditional statements in Python.

## Must Haves

- Create a new folder, initialize a git repository
- Create a separate file for each section (file names are listed per section)

## Conditionals

Save these in a file called `conditionals.py`.

### Magic Number

- First, import the [`random()` module](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/modules/random-module)
  - `import random` (It's built in to Python, it just needs to be imported!)
- Ask the user to guess a number between a certain range, i.e. between 1-10
- Make a variable called `magic_number`
- Assign a value to `magic_number` using the `random()` module, have it select an integer between the same range.
- Print the value of the `magic_number`
- Respond to the user based on their guess:
  - If they're correct give a victory message, i.e. "ARE YOU A MIND READER!?!?!"
  - If they're out of the range, i.e. they guess 12, reply with: "YOU'RE OUT OF RANGE!!"
  - If they're incorrect, tell them to try again.

```python
import random
user_input = int(input("Guess a number between 5-50: "))
magic_number = random.randint(5, 50)

print(magic_number)
rint("Sorry. Try again.")

if user_input == magic_number:
    print("ARE YOU A MIND READER!?!?!")
elif (user_input < 5) or (user_input > 50):
    print("YOU'RE OUT OF RANGE!!")
else:
    print("Sorry. Try again.")
```
