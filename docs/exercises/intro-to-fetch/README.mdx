Use these exercises to practice working with the `fetch()` API.

## Movie search

:::tip
You may need an API Key for some of these API requests. Read the docs first!
:::

Create a new app that lets the user search for movies by title. Sign up for an API key and use the data from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) or from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).

Provide the user with a form so that they can enter a movie title. On submit, make the `fetch()` request to the API. Add a `Reset` button that clears the form and the movie information on the page.

### Level 9000

:::tip
This bonus exercise will be much easider if you read/review the [Intro to Promises lesson](/docs/lessons/building-interactive-uis/intro-to-promises/#how-do-you-write-a-function-that-returns-a-promise)
:::

See if you can cache the data to `localStorage` so that your app doesn't need to make a network request for any locally stored movie data.
