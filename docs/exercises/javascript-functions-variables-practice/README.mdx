## Writing a recipe

- Write out a function definition called `marinaraSauce()`. Be sure to be mindful of your syntax!
- Inside this function, write a series of `console.log();` statements that will print the following marinara sauce recipe:
    ```sh
    - Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.
    - Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes
    - Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.
    - Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes
    - Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.
    ```
- After your function definition, write the line of code that will invoke your function

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```js
// Define the marinaraSauce() function
function marinaraSauce() {
    console.log("- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.");
}

// Call the marinaraSauce() function
marinaraSauce();
```
</details>

### Using Parameters

- In your function definition, change `marinaraSauce()` to take one parameter called `cookName`.
- Use `cookName` to print "Hey, cookName! This is my marinara sauce recipe!" before the recipe.

You can concatenate strings and variables using the `+` operator:

```js
// Define the marinaraSauce() function
function marinaraSauce(cookName) {
    console.log("Hey, " + cookName + "! This is my marinara sauce recipe!");
    console.log("- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.");
}

// Call the marinaraSauce() function
marinaraSauce();
```

This version uses the [Template literal syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

```js
// Define the marinaraSauce() function
function marinaraSauce(cookName) {
    console.log(`Hey, ${cookName}! This is my marinara sauce recipe!`);
    console.log("- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.");
}

// Call the marinaraSauce() function
marinaraSauce();
```
</details>


- Change your function invocation to take "Adam" as a `cookName`
- When you run your script, you should see  "Hey, Adam! This is my marinara sauce recipe!", followed by the recipe

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
// Define the marinaraSauce() function
function marinaraSauce(cookName) {
    console.log("Hey, " + cookName + "! This is my marinara sauce recipe!");
    console.log("- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.");
}

// Call the marinaraSauce() function
marinaraSauce("Adam");
```
</details>


### Using Variables

- At the top of your function definition, define a variable called `two`, and assign it the number value `2`
- Define another variable called "oneFourth", and assign it the string value `"1/4"`
- Use string concatenation (i.e. the "+" sign) to replace any instance of 2 or 1/4 that occurs in the recipe

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```js
// Define the marinaraSauce() function
function marinaraSauce(cookName) {
    var two = 2;
    var oneFourth = "1/4";
    console.log("Hey, " + cookName + "! This is my marinara sauce recipe!");
    console.log("- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add " + two + " tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about " + two + " minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Add " + oneFourth + " cup water, " + two + " cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes");
    console.log();
    console.log("- Stir in " + oneFourth + " cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.");
}

// Call the marinaraSauce() function
marinaraSauce("Adam");
```
