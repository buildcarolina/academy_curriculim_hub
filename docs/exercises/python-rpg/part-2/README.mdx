This exercises builds on [the work done in part 1](docs/exercises/python-rpg/part-1/)._createMdxContent

You'll update your code to reflect the changes to each class as noted below.

Doing this work on a new branch and/or new file is recommended!

## Update Characters

### Hero

- Make the hero generate double damage points during an attack with a probabilty of 20%
- Add a `coins` attribute to the `Character` class. Have it default to a value of 20.
- Add a `buy` method to the `Hero` class so that hero objects can purchase items from a virtual store (see below).
  - Give the method an `item` parameter. The item being purchased will be passed as an argument into the method.
  - It should subtract an items cost from the hero object's available `coins`

### Enemies

- Make a character called `Shadow` who has only 1 starting health but will only take damage about once out of every ten times he is attacked.
- Make a `Zombie` character that doesn't die even if their health is below zero.
- Give each enemy a bounty. For example, the prize for defeating the Goblin is 5 coins, for the Shadow it is 6 coins.

### Misc

- Come up with at least two other characters with their individual characteristics, and implement them (i.e. Wizard, Archer, Scribe)

## Go Shopping

### The Store

- Make a `Store` class to make a virtual "shop" within the game where characters can purchase items.
- Add an list called `Items`, this will be a _class variable_. Have it store two items: `Tonic` and `Sword` (see below)
- Add a `do_shopping` method to the `Store` class.
  - Have it display a welcome message and the player's current coin balance.
  - List all available items with their names and costs.
  - The `Hero` class has a `buy` method that will allow a hero object to purchse an item. The cost of the item will be subtracted from the hero object's available coins.

### Store Items

- All items have a `cost` attribute that represents the number of coins the hero will spend.
- All items have a method called `apply` that allows them to be used.
- Make a `Tonic` class that is available via the the `Items` class variable on the store object.
  - The tonic's `apply` method adds 2 to the hero's health
- Add a `Sword` class that is available via the the `Items` class variable on the store object.
  - The sword's `apply` mehtod will add 2 to the hero's power.

## Level 9000

- Create a `Battle` class with a `do_battle` method. Move the game logic into that class. (i.e. asking the user what they want to do, and acting accordingly)
- Allow items to be used on the battle field. The hero can carry the items with them, and you have the option of choosing to use a tonic at any turn in a battle.
- Make a `swap_power` method and add it to a character (or the `Character` class). This method can be used on the battle field to swap the power values of the two characters for one turn.
- There is a bug in the store that allows the hero to buy items even if he has no coins. Fix this bug.

## Solution

Here is a _possible_ solution, but keep in mind this is one of many possible approaches.

This version adds a store where the hero can buy tonic or a sword.
A tonic will add 2 to the hero's health wherease a sword will add 2 power.
