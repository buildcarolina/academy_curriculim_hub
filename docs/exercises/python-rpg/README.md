## The What

The goal for this exercise is to take the starter code of the RPG game and rewrite it using objects.

## The How

It's currently written in a procedural fashion, with a series of `while` loops and conditionals.

Your task is to refactor it and use objects/classes.

> In this simple RPG game, the hero fights the goblin.
> The hero has the options to:
>
> 1. fight goblin
> 2. do nothing - in which case the goblin will attack him anyway
> 3. flee
