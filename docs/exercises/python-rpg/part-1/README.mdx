Starter code: [https://github.com/seanrreid/python-rpg-starter](https://github.com/seanrreid/python-rpg-starter)

## Step 1

Make a `Hero` class to store the health and power of the hero, and make a `Goblin` class to store the health and power of the goblin.
Use a hero object in place of the variables `hero_health` and `hero_power` and use a goblin object in place of the variables `goblin_health` and `goblin_power`.

## Step 2

Take the code for the hero attacking the goblin and extract it into a method (call it `attack`) of the Hero class.
Replace the existing code with a call to the `attack` method.

:::tip

The `attack` method should take in the `goblin` (enemy) as a parameter: `hero.attack(goblin)`

:::

## Step 3

Similarly, take the code for the goblin attacking the hero and extract it into a method (also call it `attack`) of the Goblin class.

Replace the existing code with a call to the attack method. It should look like `goblin.attack(hero)`.

## Step 4

Refactor the while condition:

```py
while goblin.health > 0 and hero.health > 0:
```

to

```py
while goblin.alive() and hero.alive():
```

The health checks should be moved to within the alive methods of `Hero` and `Goblin` respectively.

## Step 5

Take the code for printing the health status of the hero and move it into a method called `print_status` of `Hero`. Do the same for the goblin.

## Step 6

:::tip
Do you see a lot of duplicated or similar code between `Hero` and `Goblin`?
What if you can share the duplicated code between them?

You can by using inheritance!
:::

Create a new class called `Character` and make both `Hero` and `Goblin` inherit from it.

## Step 7

The alive methods on `Hero` and `Goblin` should be identical. Move it into `Character`, and remove them from `Hero` and `Goblin` - now they can simply inherit it from `Character`.

## Bonus Challenge

The methods attack and `print_status` method in `Hero` and `Goblin` look almost identical, but not quite.

Is it possible to move them into the Character class as well? Give it a try.

## Solution

Here is a _possible_ solution, but keep in mind this is one of many possible approaches.

```py
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, health=10, power=5):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.power = power
        self.weapons = []

    def attack(self, enemy):
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name}!")
        enemy.health -= self.power

    def is_alive(self):
        return self.health > 0

class Hero(Character):
    def __init__(self, name, health, power, cape):
        super().__init__(name, health, power)
        self.cape = cape

class Villain(Character):
    def __init__(self, name, health, power):
        super().__init__(name, health, power)

hero = Hero('Batman', 20, 8, True)
villain = Villain('Joker', 40, 2)

if hero.cape == True:
    print(f"{hero.name} has a cape")
else:
    print(f"NO CAPES!")

def main():

    while villain.health > 0 and hero.health > 0:
        print("You have %d health and %d power." % (hero.health, hero.power))
        print(f"The {villain.name} has {villain.health} health and {villain.power} power.")
        print()
        print("What do you want to do?")
        print(f"1. fight {villain.name}")
        print("2. do nothing")
        print("3. flee")
        print("> ",)
        user_input = input()
        if user_input == "1":
            # Hero attacks goblin
            hero.attack(villain)
            print("You do %d damage to the %s." % (hero.power, villain.name))
            if not villain.is_alive():
                print(f"The {villain.name} is dead.")
        elif user_input == "2":
            pass
        elif user_input == "3":
            print("Goodbye.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input %r" % user_input)

        if villain.is_alive():
            # Goblin attacks hero
            villain.attack(hero)
            print("The %s does %d damage to you." % (villain.name, villain.power))
            if not hero.is_alive():
                print("You are dead.")

main()
