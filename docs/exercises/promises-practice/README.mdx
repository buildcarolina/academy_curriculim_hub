Use these exercises to practice working with JavaScript Promises.

## Stopwatch

Create a simple stopwatch app that starts the timer and shows the stopped time.

- Start the stopwatch with a promise
- End the stopwatch on a random time between 1-10 seconds
- When the stopwatch stops, display the time it took

<details>
<summary>Stopwatch Solution</summary>
```js
const between1and10secs = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
console.log(between1and10secs);

const startPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(
        () => resolve(`resolved after ${between1and10secs} seconds`),
        between1and10secs * 1000
    );
});

startPromise.then((value) => console.log(value));
```

## The Tortoise and the Hare

Create two animals (a tortoise and a hare) that race each other.

- Start each animals with a separate promise
- End each promise on a random time between 1-10 seconds
- Display the winner (or determine if it's a tie)
- Display the total time it took for each animal

<details>
<summary>Tortoise and the Hare Solution</summary>
```js
// Off to the races!
function race(animal) {
    // Build the random time in the scope of this function
    // This insures that we get a new random length each time this is run
    console.log(`${animal} has started the race!`);
    const between1and10secs = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
    // We want to return a promise...
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        // ...that will resolve between 1-10 seconds
        setTimeout(
            () =>
                resolve(
                    `${animal} finished in ${between1and10secs} seconds`
                ),
            // multiply teh random value by 1000
            // because setTimeout() uses milliseconds
            between1and10secs * 1000
        );
    });
}

const tortoisePromise = race('Tortoise');
const harePromise = race('Hare');

Promise.race([tortoisePromise, harePromise])
    .then((winner) => {
        // the `winner` variable is assigned to whichever promise finishes first...
        // it's the value that is returned via onfullfilled
        // ...so we can tell the user who won.
        console.log(`Winner: ${winner}\n`);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Just in case something busted, let's log it
        console.error(`Error: ${error}`);
    })
    .finally(() => {
        // Once all the promises are done, we return the times
        Promise.all([tortoisePromise, harePromise]).then(
            ([tortoiseResult, hareResult]) => {
                console.log(tortoiseResult);
                console.log(hareResult);
            }
        );
    });
```
