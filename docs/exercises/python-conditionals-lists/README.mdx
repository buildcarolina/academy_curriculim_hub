Use these exercises to practice working with conditional statements, `while` loops, and Lists in Python.

## Must Haves

- Create a new folder, initialize a git repository
- Create a separate file for each section (file names are listed per section)

## Conditionals

Save these in a file called `conditionals.py`.

### Magic Number

- First, import the [`random()` module](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/modules/random-module)
  - `import random` (It's built in to Python, it just needs to be imported!)
- Ask the user to guess a number between a certain range, i.e. between 1-10
- Make a variable called `magic_number`
- Assign a value to `magic_number` using the `random()` module, have it select an integer between the same range.
- Print the value of the `magic_number`
- Respond to the user based on their guess:
  - If they're correct give a victory message, i.e. "ARE YOU A MIND READER!?!?!"
  - If they're out of the range, i.e. they guess 12, reply with: "YOU'RE OUT OF RANGE!!"
  - If they're incorrect, tell them to try again.

```python
import random
user_input = int(input("Guess a number between 5-50: "))
magic_number = random.randint(5, 50)

print(magic_number)
rint("Sorry. Try again.")

if user_input == magic_number:
    print("ARE YOU A MIND READER!?!?!")
elif (user_input < 5) or (user_input > 50):
    print("YOU'RE OUT OF RANGE!!")
else:
    print("Sorry. Try again.")
```

## Lists

Save these in a file called `lists.py`.

### Part 1 - Change a List

- Use the following list: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99, 2600, 300]`
- There is a Python method that will [reverse a list](https://realpython.com/python-reverse-list/).
- Create a new variable called `reversed_list` and assign it the reversed value of `numbers`.
- Print the values of each list.

<summary>Solution</summary>
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99, 2600, 300]

print(numbers)
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)
```
</details>

### Part 2 - String to List

- Make a string with at least 6 characters.
- Make an empty list (hint: create a variable, it's value will look like an empty array in JavaScript)
- Loop through each letter in your string and for each letter in the string, append it to the empty list.
- Revese the list.
- Create a new variable that is an empty string (just like in JavaScript).
- Loop through the list, for each letter in the list, add it to the new string your created.
- Print out the new string. It should be the reversed version of the string you created. i.e. "sean" -> "neas".

```python
test_stuff = "Do rad stuff."

string_list = []
for letter in test_stuff:
    string_list.append(letter)
print(string_list)
string_list.reverse()
print(string_list)

new_string = ""
for letter in string_list:
    new_string += letter
print(new_string)
```
</details>

### Part 3 - List + Conditional

- Make a new list containing members of your favorite band/sports team/television show.
- Write a conditional statement to check if a specific person is in that list.
  - If they are in the list, remove them.
  - If they're not in the list, add them.
- Can you write a condition that does _both_ of these checks.
  - **HINT:** Think like this: "If the person exists, then remove them. Otherwise, if they don't, add them.
- Print the updated list.

```python
power_rangers = [
    "Jason",
    "Trini",
    "Zack",
    "Kim",
    "Billy",
    "Tommy"
]

print(power_rangers)
if "Tommy" in power_rangers:
    power_rangers.remove("Tommy")
    print(power_rangers)
else:
    print("IT'S MORPHIN TIME!")
```
