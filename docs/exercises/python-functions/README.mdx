## Functions

Many of these will look familiar to previous exercises. This time we're going to _specifically_ write them using functions.

### Madlib function

Write a function that accepts two arguments: a name and a subject.

The function should return a String with the name and subject interpolated in.

For example:

```py
madlib("Jenn", "science")
# "Jenn's favorite subject is science."

madlib("Jeff", "history")
# "Jeff's favorite subject is history."
```

Provide default arguments in case one or both are omitted.

    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    def madlib(name, subject):
        the_madlib = "Your name is %s and your favorite subject is %s" % (
            name, subject)
        return the_madlib

    my_story = madlib("Sean", "English")
    print(my_story)
    ```
</details>

### Conversions

#### Celsius to Fahrenheit

The formula to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

`F = (C * 9/5) + 32`

Write a function that takes a temperature in Celsius, converts it Fahrenheit, and returns the value.

#### Fahrenheit to Celsius

The formula to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:

`C = (F - 32) * 5/9`

Write a function that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius, and returns the value.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    # Celsius to Fahrenheit

    user_input = int(input("Enter a temperature in Celsius: "))

    def convert_temp_f(celcius):
        return (celcius * 9/5) + 32

    farhrenheit = convert_temp_f(user_input)
    print(farhrenheit)

    # Fahrenheit to Celsius

    user_input_2 = int(input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit"))

    def convert_temp_c(fahrenheit):
        return (fahrenheit - 32 ) * 5/9

    celcius = convert_temp_c(user_input_2)
    print(celcius)
    ```
</details>

### Odd & Even

#### `is_even` function

Write a function that accepts a number as an argument and returns a Boolean value. Return `True` if the number is even; return `False` if it is not even.

#### `is_odd` function

Write an `is_odd` function that uses your `is_even` function to determine if a number is odd. (That is, do not do the calculation - call a function that does the calculation.)

Hint: You'll use the `not` keyword.

#### `only_evens` function

Write a function that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.

Return a new List that includes the only the even numbers.

```py
only_evens([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10])
# Returns [20, 42, 10]
```

Hint: use your `is_even()` function to determine which numbers to include in your new List.

#### `only_odds` function

Write a function that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.

Return a new List that includes the only the odd numbers.

```py
only_odds([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10])
# Returns [11, 97, 23]
```

Hint: use your `is_odd()` function to determine which numbers to include in your new List.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    # `is_even` function

    def is_even(number):
        if (number % 2) == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    print(is_even(4))
    print(is_even(75))

    # `is_odd` function

    def is_odd(number):
        if (number % 2) != 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    print(is_odd(11))
    print(is_odd(42))

    # `only_evens` function

    def only_evens(numbers):
        i = 0
        even_numbers = []
        while i < len(numbers):
            if (numbers[i] % 2) == 0:
                even_numbers.append(numbers[i])
            i = i + 1
        return even_numbers

    print(only_evens([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10]))

    # `only_odds` function

    # Version 1: Using a `while` loop

    def only_odds_while(numbers):
        i = 0
        odd_numbers = []
        while i < len(numbers):
            if (numbers[i] % 2) != 0:
                odd_numbers.append(numbers[i])
            i = i + 1
        return odd_numbers

    print(only_odd_while([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10]))

    # Version 2: Using a `for` loop

    def only_odds_for(numbers):
        odd_numbers = []
        for n in numbers:
            if (n % 2) != 0:
                odd_numbers.append(n)
        return odd_numbers

    print(only_odd_for([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10]))
    ```

### Smallest vs Largest

#### Find the smallest number

- Write a function `smallest` that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.
- It should return the smallest number in the List.

##### Find the largest number

- Write a function `largest` that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.
- It should return the largest number in the List.

### Longest vs Shortest

#### Find the shortest String

- Write a function `shortest` that accepts a List of Strings as an argument.
- It should return the shortest String in the List.

#### Find the longest String

- Write a function `longest` that accepts a List of Strings as an argument.
- It should return the longest String in the List.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    def shortest(list_of_strings):
        # This is our starting placeholder value
        # We'll start with the first item in the list
        # and compare every other item against it
        shortest = list_of_strings[0]
        i = 0
        while i < len(list_of_strings):
            if (len(list_of_strings[i]) <= len(shortest)):
                shortest = list_of_strings[i]
            i += 1
        return shortest

    def longest(list_of_strings):
        # This is our starting placeholder value
        longest = list_of_strings[0]
        i = 0
        while i < len(list_of_strings):
            if (len(list_of_strings[i]) >= len(longest)):
                longest = list_of_strings[i]
            i += 1
        return longest

    some_strings = ['of', 'crackle', 'foo', 'a', 'bard', 'fizzle']

    print(shortest(some_strings))
    print(longest(some_strings))
    ```

## Level 9000

### Change maker

Write a function that calculates how many bills and coins someone would receive as change.

Write a function `make_change` that accepts two arguments:

- `total_charge` - the amount of money owed
- `payment` - the amount of money payed

Return a 2-dimensional [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=tuple#tuple) whose values represent the bills and coins.
<br/>(see [Reminder](/docs/exercises/python-functions/#reminder-from-wes-boss) below for additional info on tuples)

#### Reminder from Wes Boss

Calling back to this [podcast transcript quote](/docs/cohorts/cohort17/lectures/week1/day4/#things-i-wish-i-heard-20-years-ago)

> A tuple is a very scary sounding name for an array where you the length and the item types are known.

#### Follow Up Reminder from Sean

In Python:

- Tuples are ordered collections of objects enclosed in parentheses `()`
- Each element within the tuple occupies a specific position starting at index 0
- Unlike lists, tuples can't be directly changed, aka "immutable"

---

For example, consider the following tuple:

```py
# Example change tuple
(
  (3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
  (4, 1, 0, 2)
)
```

The first item represents the bills:

- 3 singles
- 0 fives
- 1 ten
- 1 twenty
- 0 fifties
- 1 hundred

The second item represents the coins

- 4 pennies
- 1 nickel
- 0 dimes
- 2 quarters

Your function `make_change()` will return a tuple that resembles the above example based on the values the user gives for `payment` and `total_change`.

Hint: consider writing a small function to help produce the "bills" tuple and another function to help produce the "coins" tuple.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    def generate_bills(bills):
        # Convert string input to integer, because maths
        bills = int(bills)
        # Calculate the number of each denomination
        # Order matters here!
        # Starting with singles will spit out a stack of $1 bills!
        hundreds = bills // 100 # divide the bills by hundreds
        bills %= 100            # update the bills to no longer count the hundreds
        fifties = bills // 50   # divide by fifties
        bills %= 50             # update the bills to no longer count the fifties
        twenties = bills // 20  # divide by twenties
        bills %= 20             # update the bills to no longer count the twenties
        tens = bills // 10      # divide by tens
        bills %= 10             # update the bills to no longer count the tens
        fives = bills // 5      # divide by fives
        bills %= 5              # update the bills to no longer count the fives
        singles = bills // 1    # finish up with the singles
        return (singles, fives, tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds)

    def generate_coins(coins):
        coins = int(coins)
        quarters = coins // 25
        coins %= 25
        dimes = coins // 10
        coins %= 10
        nickels = coins // 5
        coins %= 5
        pennies = coins // 1
        return (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters)

    def make_change(total, payment):
        difference = round(payment - total, 2)
        difference_string = str(difference)
        parts = difference_string.split('.')
        bills_part = parts[0]
        coins_part = parts[1]

        bills_tuple = generate_bills(bills_part)
        coins_tuple = generate_coins(coins_part)
        return (bills_tuple, coins_tuple)

    change_as_tuple = make_change(201.61, 300)

    print("Change as tuple is: {}".format(change_as_tuple))
    ```
</details>

### Calculate the change value

Write a `value_of_change` function that accepts a 2-dimensional tuple like the one returned by the `make_change` function.

This function should calculate the monetary value specified by the tuple.

For example, if the following tuple were passed to `value_of_change`

```py
(
  (3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
  (4, 1, 0, 2)
)
```

It would return `133.59`

As before, consider writing helper functions to deal with the bills and the coins separately.

    ```py
    change_as_tuple = (
        (3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
        (4, 1, 0, 2)
    )
    def generate_bills(bills):
        # Calculate the number of each denomination
        hundreds = bills[5] * 100
        fifties = bills[4] * 50
        twenties = bills[3] * 20
        tens = bills[2] * 10
        fives = bills[1] * 5
        singles = bills[0] * 1
        total = hundreds + fifties + twenties + tens + fives + singles
        return total

    def generate_coins(coins):
        quarters = coins[3] * 25
        dimes = coins[2] * 10
        nickels = coins[1] * 5
        pennies = coins[0] * 1
        total = quarters + dimes + nickels + pennies
        return total

    def value_of_change(tuple):
        bills_total = generate_bills(tuple[0])
        coins_total = generate_coins(tuple[1])
        total_change = '$' + str(bills_total) + '.' + str(coins_total)
        return total_change

    cash_value = value_of_change(change_as_tuple)

    print("The cash value is: {}".format(cash_value))
    ```
