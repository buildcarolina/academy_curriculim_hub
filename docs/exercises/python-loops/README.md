## While Loop

Save these in a file called `loops.py`.

### Part 1 - Start/End

- Ask the user for a starting number, assign it to a variable.
- Ask the user for an ending number, assign it to a variable.
- Write a loop that increments the starting number by `1` until it matches the ending number.

### Part 2 - Multi-Condition Check

- Create string with at least 2 words and at least 16 characters total.
- Create a variable called `counter` with a starting value of `0`
- Loop through the string
  - Increment the `counter` by `1`
  - Stop the loop when `counter` is greater than the length of your string.
- _IN THE LOOP_
  - Write a condition to see If the `counter` value is an even number.
  - Also make sure the value of your string at the index of `counter` isn't a blank space!
  - If **both** of those conditions are met, print the value of your string at that counter position
- The result should be only _letters_ that occur in even numbered indexes.

#### Bonus

- Can you write a loop that increments by more than `1`?
- Can you create a range of numbers from which the user can choose?
- Can you let the user know when they choose something out of that range?
