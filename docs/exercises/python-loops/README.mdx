Use these exercises to practice working with conditional statements, `while` loops, and Lists in Python.

## Must Haves

- Create a new folder, initialize a git repository
- Create a separate file for each section (file names are listed per section)

## While Loop

Save these in a file called `loops.py`.

### Start/End

- Ask the user for a starting number, assign it to a variable.
- Ask the user for an ending number, assign it to a variable.
- Write a loop that increments the starting number by `1` until it matches the ending number.

  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```py
    start = int(input("Start from: "))
    end = int(input("End on: "))

    count = start

    while count <= end:
        print(count)
        count += 1
  ```
</details>

### Multi-Condition Check

- Create string with at least 2 words and at least 16 characters total.
- Create a variable called `counter` with a starting value of `0`
- Loop through the string
  - Increment the `counter` by `1`
  - Stop the loop when `counter` is greater than the length of your string.
- _IN THE LOOP_
  - Write a condition to see If the `counter` value is an even number.
  - Also make sure the value of your string at the index of `counter` isn't a blank space!
  - If **both** of those conditions are met, print the value of your string at that counter position
- The result should be only _letters_ that occur in even numbered indexes.

    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    title = "Green Lantern Corp"
    counter = 0
    while counter < len(title):
        # print out every other letters, but leave out spaces
        if (counter % 2) == 0 and title[counter] != " ":
            print(title[counter])
        counter = counter + 1
    ```
</details>

## Bonus

- Can you write a loop that increments by more than `1`?
- Can you create a range of numbers from which the user can choose?
- Can you let the user know when they choose something out of that range?

    ```py
    # Can you write a loop that increments by more than `1`?

    while count <= end:
        print(count)
        count += 5


    # Can you create a range of numbers from which the user can choose?

    def check_in_range(num):
        if num >= 1 and num <= 5:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # Can you let the user know when they choose something out of that range?

    def throw_error(value_type):
        return "Please choose a different {} value".format(value_type)

    running = True
    while running == True:
        start = int(input("Pick a number from 1-5 to start from: "))
        end = int(input("Pick a number from 1-5 to end on: "))

        if check_in_range(start) == True and check_in_range(end) == True:
            if end <= start:
                print(throw_error("end"))
            while start <= end:
                print(start)
                start += 1
                if start == end:
                    running = False
        else:
            if check_in_range(start) == False:
                print(throw_error("start"))
            if check_in_range(end) == False or end >= start:
                print(throw_error("end"))
    ```
