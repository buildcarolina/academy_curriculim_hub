## Learn Python Exercises

Start with these exercises from [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).

They can be done in the browser, but it will be helpful to save copies locally for review in the future.

### For local copies

- Make a directory called `learnpython`
- For each exercise, save your work in a file with a `.py` extension
  <br/>For example, the first lesson would be saved in a file named `hello_world.py`

I **strongly recommend** reading everything before starting the exercises!

1 [Learn Python: Hello World](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
2 [Learn Python: Functions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions)
3 [Learn Python: Conditions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions)
4 [Learn Python: Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
