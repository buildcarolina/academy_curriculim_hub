## Learn Python Exercises

Start with these exercises from [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).  They can be done in the browser, but you should also save copies locally for review in the future. Put them in a directory called `learnpython`.

I **strongly recommend** reading everything before starting the exercises!

* [Learn Python: Hello World](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
* [Learn Python: Functions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions)
* [Learn Python: Conditions](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions)
* [Learn Python: Loops](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
