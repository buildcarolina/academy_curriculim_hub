Use this exercises to practice working with Lists and string interpolation in Python.

## Must Haves

- Create a new folder, initialize a git repository
- Create a file called `madlibs.py`

## String interpolation + Lists

- Define the necessary word types, i.e. "noun, verb, adjective," using a list.
- The words will be the `key`, the initial `value` for each `key` will be blank
- Using the list, prompt the user for input to update the `value` for each `key`
- Using String Interpolation, print a silly sentence with those words.
