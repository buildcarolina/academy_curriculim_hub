## Must Haves

### Install required libraries with `pipenv`

1. Activate Shell
  - `pipenv shell`
  - If you get an error running `pipenv`, try `python3 -m pipenv shell`
2. Install libraries
  - `pipenv install fastapi uvicorn`
  - IIf you get an error running `pipenv`, try `python3 -m pipenv install fastapi uvicorn`

## Time for CRUD

Create a CRUD backend to manage a school.

:star: [This article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy_orm_working_with_joins.htm) might be helpful for some of the `GET` routes that require a `JOIN` statement.

:star: [This documentation about `ForeignKey` types](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/constraints.html#defining-foreign-keys) will also be helpful.

### Create your database

Setup a database, choose a name that sounds like a school.

Create the following tables/fields:

- `students`
  - `id`
  - `name`
- `courses`
  - 'id'
  - `name`
- `enrollments`
  - `id`
  - `student_id` -> This will be a `FOREIGN KEY` field pointing to `students(id)`
  - `course_id`  -> This will be a `FOREIGN KEY` field pointing to `courses(id)`

### Setup all the necessary CRUD routes

- Create
  - POST `/create/student`
  - POST `/create/course`
  - POST `/create/enrollment`
- Read
  - GET `/`
  - GET `/students`
  - GET `/courses`
  - GET `/enrollment`
- Update
  - PUT `/update/student/{id}`
  - PUT `/update/course/{id}`
  - PUT `/update/enrollment/{id}`
- Delete
  - PUT `/delete/student/{id}`
  - PUT `/delete/course/{id}`
  - PUT `/delete/enrollment/{id}`

### Test your routes

- Test your routes using the Swagger docs, or Bruno (or both!)

### Bonus

- Write a webpage to `fetch()` the `GET` routes
- Show the results on the page

### Double Bonus

- Write a form that accepts input to match the `Create` routes.
- The [Supplying request options to `fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#supplying_request_options) documentation will be helpful.

### Level 9000

- Write a form that accepts input to make updates via `Update` routes.
