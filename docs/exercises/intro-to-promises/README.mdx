### Stopwatch

Create a simple stopwatch app that starts the timer and shows the stopped time.

- Start the stopwatch with a promise
- End the stopwatch on a random time between 1-10 seconds
- When the stopwatch stops, display the time it took

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
```
const between1and10secs = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
console.log(between1and10secs);

const startPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(
        () => resolve(`resolved after ${between1and10secs} seconds`),
        between1and10secs * 1000
    );
});

startPromise.then((value) => console.log(value));
```

### The Tortoise and the Hare

Create two animals (a tortoise and a hare) that race each other.

- Start each animals with a separate promise
- End each promise on a random time between 1-10 seconds
- Display the winner (or determine if it's a tie)
- Display the total time it took for each animal

## Large

### Movie search

Create a new app that lets the user search for movies by title. Sign up for an API key and use the data from the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) or from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).

Provide the user with a form so that they can enter a movie title. On submit, make the `fetch()` request to the API. Add a `Reset` button that clears the form and the movie information on the page.

After you have confirmed that you can successfully `fetch()` data and `.catch()` errors, cache the data to `localStorage` so that your app doesn't need to make a network request for any locally stored movie data.
