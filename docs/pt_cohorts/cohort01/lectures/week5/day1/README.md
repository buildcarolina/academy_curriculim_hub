## Types of programming

1. **Imperative programming** is writing code that tells the computer _how_ to do something.
   > "Hey, Computer, if a user gives you value [x] then perform action [y]."
2. **Decalartive programming** is writing code that tell the computer _what_ you want to see.
   > "Hey, Computer, this content needs to look like this..."
