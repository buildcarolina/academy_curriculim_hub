## Magic 8 Ball

For this section, our project is going to be a [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball)!

You'll brainstorm to build out the application and use that to determine how to build the page.

### Questions to answer

- What are the most important items to convey to the user?
- How do you remove "friction" (i.e. make it easy for the user to use and/or register to use the app)
- What content is the most important, and how do you make sure it's easy to get to?
- How do you model the site navigation to match this hiearchy?

Bonus:

- What's the ideal user "path" to use the app?
- What happens if (or, realistically, when) the users don't use the app the way you intended?? ðŸ¤”

### Design it!

:::info

Note that we'll use class time today to come up with a _design_.  Then you'll start coding it out before Thursday's class.

::::

Using your answers to the previous questions as a guide, find some design inspiration for your app.

Resources you could try for inspiration:

- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
  <br/>Register for an account to search (it's free) and then enter a search term. You can filter by "web designs"

## Notes

- You're not likely to find an inspiration that matches _all_ of your goals. The goal is to get something to give you a general direction, _not_ the final product.
- There is an example site online here: [Magic 8 Ball Online](https://magic-8ball.com/), how would you change/improve it? -->
