title: Week 5 - The Web, the Browser, HTML & CSS
---

The last few weeks we've spent time solving problems with Python.

Specifically we've looked at:

* Variables
* Data Type
* Functions
* Procedural Programming
* Object Oriented Programming (classes & objects)

This week we'll move on to the internet!

* How does the internet work? (Hint: it's all `request` and `response`)
* The browser and the Document Object Model (DOM)
* HTML + CSS + JavaScript
