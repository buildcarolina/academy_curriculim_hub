### STYLE IT UP!

Update the skeleton to reflect the design using various CSS properties.

#### Start here

Here's a recommended order:

1. Apply colors
2. Update fonts

#### THEN

1. Start with a mobile layout (dev tools!)
2. Do your positioning
   - Default to **small-screen first**, then see how it works on a larger screen!
3. Add images
4. Keep testing to see how the content "pours" into different screensizes
