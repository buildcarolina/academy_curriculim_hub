## Putting React Away (for now...)

We're going to wrap up React and move into backend work next week.

Today we're going to simply review where we are with Shrink Ray UI specifically, and React more generally.

## Questions to answer

- Why `src`?
- What's in `public`?
- Where do I put my images?
- What does `npm run build` do?

## Notes and Video
