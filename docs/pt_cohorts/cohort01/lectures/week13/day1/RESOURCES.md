## General

- [Cassidy Williams: Tips for Posting on LinkedIn](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/posting-on-linkedin/)
- [The Importance of Kindness in Engineering](<https://ashouri.xyz/post/kindnessinengineering?utm_source=tldrwebdev>)
- [Most ints are not floats](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/06/27/most-ints-are-not-floats/?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
  <br/>If you wanted to take a deep dive into math, and how computers handle numbers, this is a solid read!

## Web Dev

- [The Essential Web Developer's Checklist](https://webdev-checklist.vercel.app/)
  <br/>I just came across this checklist this morning. It looks really helpful, and can possibly be added to any existing project?
- [Tailwind is the worst form of CSS, except for all the others](https://www.mux.com/blog/tailwind-is-the-worst-form-of-css-except-for-all-the-others?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
  <br/>The title sums up my opinion well, but the author does a good job of taking a deeper dive into the benefits of Tailwind.
- [Understanding React Re-Renders](https://shramko.dev/blog/react-rerender?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
  <br/>We've talked about this briefly, this goes into a lot more detail.  __Highly recommended reading__!

## Auth

We'll get to auth soon-ish, these are both helpful discussions in advance of trying it ourselves.

- :headphones: [Syntax.FM: How To Build Your Own Auth](https://syntax.fm/show/336/how-to-build-your-own-auth)
- :headphones: [Syntax.FM: How To Pick a JavaScript Framework: Discussing Auth](https://syntax.fm/show/835/how-to-pick-a-javascript-framework#t=38:45)
  <br/>I linked directly to the section on Auth, there are quite a few options covered there.
