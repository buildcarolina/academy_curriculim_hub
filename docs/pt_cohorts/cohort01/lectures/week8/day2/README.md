## In Class

### Group Exercise

The [Shopping List Exercise](https://github.com/seanrreid/busted_shopping_DOM) is busted!

- Fork & clone this :point_up: repo, then find and fix the errors to make it work!
- HINT: There are at least 5 of them (possibly more, but there are at least 5 that I intentionally created)

### Discussion

- Review & debug the [JS Airlines Exercise](/docs/exercises/js-airlines/)
- Here is [my solution to the JS Airlines Exercise](https://github.com/seanrreid/js-airlines-solution)

## Time Permitting:

- [_JS is Weird_: The JavaScript Quiz You'll Love to Hate](https://jsisweird.com/)
- Answers from our quiz are here -> [JS Is Weird Answers](./JS_ss_Weird.pdf)

## Reference

- [WTF JavaScript Repo](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs?tab=readme-ov-file#what-the-fck-javascript)
  <br/>This is a collection of things people find odd in JavaScript, including explanations for **why** things are that way (many of which made up the _JS is Weird_ quiz!).
