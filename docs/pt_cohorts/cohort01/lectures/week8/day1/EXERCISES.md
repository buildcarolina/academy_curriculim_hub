## JavaScript Challenges

### Dev Mode: Difficult

These range from Beginner to Advanced, and can be legitimately _difficult_. However, they're the kind of things that frequently pop up during technical interviews.
Don't try to tackle all of them at once!  I recommend bookmarking this repo and returning to this from time to time and pick a topic to learn about.

### Dev Mode: Entertaining

These challenges range in difficulty, but are designed to help you improve your JavaScript skills with regular practice. They're not nearly as challenging as the Algorithms and Data Structures Repository.
