## Revenge of the Magic 8 Ball!

Write a React version of your Magic 8 Ball!

- Make a new React app (reminder steps below)
- Use _your_ Magic 8 Ball exercise as a guide, make a React version.

### Using `vite` to generate a new React app

:::warning
REMINDER: If you see `[your app name]` that means to replace _all_ of that with your app name, _remove the brackets!_

For example: `npm create vite@latest [your app name]` would be written as `npm create vite@latest my-super-cool-app-that-i-am-making-and-not-using-brackets-in-the-name-here`
:::

```sh
npm create vite@latest [your app name]
```

Then answer the following questions:

```sh
? Select a framework: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Vanilla
    Vue
>   React
    Preact
    Lit
    Svelte
    Solid
    Qwik
    Others

? Select a variant: › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    TypeScript
    TypeScript + SWC
❯   JavaScript
    JavaScript + SWC
```

Once it's done installing you'll see:

```sh
Done. Now run:

cd [your app name]
npm install
npm run dev
```
