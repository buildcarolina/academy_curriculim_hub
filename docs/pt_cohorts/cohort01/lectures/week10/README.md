## Outline

Here's a general outline of what the next 2(ish) weeks will look like:

### What we've discussed

- Introducing React
  - Quick history & purpose
- Reactive rendering: the virtual DOM
  - Generating a virtual DOM
  - [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and the render tree

### What's coming up

- Component-based architecture
  - React components
  - Relationships (import/export)
  - Mounting to the DOM (`<App>`)
  - The component life cycle
  - [JSX templating](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- React data flow
  - "Data down, actions up"
  - Antipatterns: Prop drilling
