## Getting Started

React has changed quite a bit recently, i.e. a fairly drastic change in the last couple of years.

**Read this first!** -> [Create-React-App Evolution (Bitsrc.io)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-future-of-react-why-create-react-app-is-deprecated-and-hooks-are-the-future-83e8a087a325)
<br/>This documents the recent changes to React, notably that the long-standing `create-react-app` is no longer beings supported.

**Read this second** -> [The Two Reacts](https://overreacted.io/the-two-reacts/)
<br/>React is _actively_ changing and there has been a push towards Server Side Components. This article touches on that thought process.

**Then read this** ->  [React 'Aha' Moments](https://ui.dev/react-aha-moments/)
<br/>This one is ðŸ¤Œ, even still today (it was published in 2016)
