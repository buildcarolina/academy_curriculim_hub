## The First Hour (possibly longer...)

- Break into groups (aka Sean will create breakout rooms)
- Complete, debug, or start the [JavaScript OMDB Movie Lookup](/docs/exercises/js-movie-review/)
- We'll review and do a code walk through when the first hour is done

## Then...

### The story so far...

- We've learned how to work with variables, functions, and solving problems with code (Python & JavaScript)
- We built Object Oriented Programs with Python
- We've built and styled HTML pages
- We've included external data in HTML via `fetch()` requests

## Application Architecture

We're moving from simple DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests into _more complex_ DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests. ðŸ˜‰

Notably, we're moving in the realm of "Single Page Applications" aka "SPA."
