## Let's all go to the movies!

We'll start with reviews of either the OMDB exercises or JS Air.

then...

## Presentations

- [JS Prototypes and Classes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fS7BzlMH5VWRoqsnhZ-hr8MZ06pFLXLh3mN1SbExds8/edit?usp=sharing)
  <br/>JavaScript doesn't technically have "classes" the same way a language like Python does. But, what it does have are Prototypes!

## Review

- [React, but without React](https://github.com/seanrreid/react-without-react)
  <br/>This repo contains some examples of patterns that we'll learn in React, but implemented using just plain "vanilla" JavaScript.

## Good Advice for Forward Progress:

> When you focus on the outcome, the gap between where you are and where you want to go seems large. To cover ground quickly, the tendency is to look for a hack or shortcut.
> The problem is that no one who got the outcomes you wanted used a hack or shortcut to get them. Instead, they consistently inched forward.
> Instead of focusing on the ultimate outcome, focus on the next move. There is always something you can do today to get a little better, to move a little closer, to put yourself in a better position. It's not pretty. It's not sexy. It's not fast. It doesn't even make for a good story. But it works.
> You don't build an empire in a day. You build it brick by brick. Day by day.
> Consistent daily progress for a long period of time.
