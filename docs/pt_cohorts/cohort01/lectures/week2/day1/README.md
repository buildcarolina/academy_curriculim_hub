## Things I wish I heard 20 years ago

**NOTE** The podcast is auto-transcibed, so some of it reads differently than it was spoken. I've shared the relevant quote below, but the entire show is worth a listen!

> All the time, I learn about something new called, predicate inference pattern on composition member inheritance proxies, when it's just some plain old function thing I've written 10,000,000 times. [...]
> A tuple is a very scary sounding name for an array where you know the length and the item types are known. So if you have an array of an ID and a person, and the 1st item is the ID and 2nd item is a person, that's a tuple.
