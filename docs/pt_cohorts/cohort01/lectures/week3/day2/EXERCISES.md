## First read/watch these

- [Python OOPs Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRu1GAfr3LA) :movie_camera:
  <br/>This is a solid breakdown and worth the ~30 minutes to review the concepts.
- [How to explain object-oriented programming concepts to a 6-year-old](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)
  <br/>This is a great approach from Free Code Camp, and, as a bonus, they review the key principles that you'll likely need for a job interview.

## Then do these

Your goal: Take the starter code of the RPG game and rewrite it using objects.

It's currently written in a procedural fashion, with a series of `while` loops and conditionals. Follow the steps to make it Object Oriented.

Instructions can be found in the [Python RPG Exercise](/docs/exercises/python-rpg/)
