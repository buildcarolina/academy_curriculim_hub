## General

- [How to be the best programmer, according to Daniel Terhorst-North](https://shiftmag.dev/the-best-programmer-daniel-terhorst-north-3526/)

I think this is my favorite item from the list:

> Most people want to do something only if they can do it well. We fear showing that we’re not good at something. The best programmers know that it’s just ego and that they don’t have to do a good or the right job every time. They write their code with a motto: ‘If it’s not good, I’ll rewrite it!’
