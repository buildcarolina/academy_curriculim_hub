## Reactive 8 Ball Review

- Let's show'n'tell'n'debug your React-ified Magic 8 Ball Projects

## Fetching Data in React

- Then we'll work on how/where/when to `fetch()` data in a React app (hint: it's mostly `useEffect`)
- We'll query the Shrink Ray API [https://bzzt.fun/api/urls](https://bzzt.fun/api/urls)

## Conditional Rendering

Well, this is confusing as hell!

- Old React says: [If-Else in JSX](https://react-cn.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html)
    > if-else statements don't work inside JSX. This is because JSX is just syntactic sugar for function calls and object construction.
- But new React says: [Conditional Rendering](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)
    > Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.

:::tip
NOTE: Part of the confusion with `if-then` statements rises from using them _inside_ of the component's JSX, which _doesn't_ work.
However, you _can_ use `if-then` statements to _return_ different JSX values!
