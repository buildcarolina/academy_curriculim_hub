title: Week 4 - Wrapping up Python, moving on to the Internet
---

This week we'll wrap up our OOP Python projects and play Arcade-O-Rama

At the end of this week, leading into next week we'll move on to the internet!

* How does the internet work? (Hint: it's all `request` and `response`)
* The browser and the Document Object Model (DOM)
* HTML + CSS + JavaScript
