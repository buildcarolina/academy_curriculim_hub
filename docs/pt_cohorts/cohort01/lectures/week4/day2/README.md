## Arcade-o-Rama

![Pinky's Arcard in Taylors Mill](./img/pinkys_arcade.jpg)

- We'll spend the first hour debugging/testing/preparing.
- Then we'll be reviewing/playing everyone's Python games!

### Rules

- If your game is working, then you'll present your game, demo your code, and demonstrate how to play.
- If the game isn't working, then we'll debug as a group and _then_ then demonstrate game play.

### Presentation Guidelines

- Explain your game in a succint, easy to understand, manner; "I wrote a Death Race Clone where you race 5 other vehicles across a dystopian hellscape."
- Show your code and give a _brief_ breakdown of how you approached the assignment.
- Discuss _one_ struggle and _two_ victories that you experienced during the process of creating your game.
  <br/> :warning: We will do this step with every presentation! The ratio is always _two_ victories for each struggle.
- Demo game play!
