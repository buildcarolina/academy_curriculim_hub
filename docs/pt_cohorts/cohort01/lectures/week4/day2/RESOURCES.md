## Python

- :movie_camera:[Python Crash Course Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSbJ7w914ZvDvwKUlhFIiMVS30xB5Fjwf)
  <br/>These look to be solid videos if you want to go back and review any of the topics we've discussed so far (and some that we haven't).  None of them are that long, the longest is about 19 minutes?

## Mozilla Developer Network Guides

- [List of HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

## Hypertext/HTML

- [Know a Little More: About Hypertext](https://dailytechnewsshow.com/2023/09/14/about-hypertext/)
  <br/>This is a fantastic look at the history of Hypertext, and how it laid the groundwork for _all_ of the internet. It's a Must Listen!
- [Getting to know HTML](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/)
- [My current HTML boilerplate](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/)
- [Cutting the Mustard - 2018 Edition](https://fettblog.eu/cutting-the-mustard-2018/)
  <br/>Slightly dated at this point, but still relevant

## Git

- [Do we think of git commits as diffs, snapshots, and/or histories?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/01/05/do-we-think-of-git-commits-as-diffs--snapshots--or-histories/)

## General

- [Words, by Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html)
  <br/>Well done example of the power of just HTML
- [Review: _Space Jam_ Site](https://mxb.dev/blog/space-jam/)
  <br/>Solid review of the original Space Jam site, and the current version
- [One line of code that did cost $8,000](https://pietrasiak.com/one-line-of-code-that-did-cost-dollar8000?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
  <br/>The title is _not_ clickbait, which is somehow even more crazy!
- [Frontend at Scale: Fear and Curiosity and AI](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/46)
  > "Reports of AI taking the joy out of programming have been greatly exaggerated. In my experience, when the bots take over the tedious parts, they don’t take away the joy—they clear more space for it."
