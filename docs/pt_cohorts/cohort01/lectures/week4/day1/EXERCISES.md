To quote Fleetwood Mac, this time "You can go your own way!"

## Build your own RPG

Using the Warrior RPG as a guide, create a brand new RPG game.

Here are some possible ideas based on previous students' work:

- Murder mystery (ala the game/movie "Clue", or tv show "How to Get Away with Murder")
- Race across the country (ala "Twisted Metal," "Death Race 2000," "Cannonball Run")
- Sports! (literally, football, basketball, baseball, golf)

## Level 10K - PyGame

In the past I've had students use the PyGame framework to generate their own "platformer" games (think old school video games).

Here are a couple links to tutorials that students have found helpful:

- [Kids Can Code: PyGame](https://kidscancode.org/lessons/)
- [PyGame Tutorials (Official Docs)](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials)
- [YouTube: PyGame in 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9VG3Pztok8&t=430s)

## Examples
