## Career

- [The Caring Techie Newsletter: How to avoid sleepwalking into irrelevance in the age of AI](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/how-to-avoid-sleepwalking-into-irrelevance)
  <br/>The entire article is full of sound advice for _every_ career stage with regards to AI.
  <br/>However, I believe the following advice applies even _beyond_ AI:

  > ## Letting go of perfect plans and long roadmaps
  >
  > Even the OpenAI CPO thinks long roadmaps are a bad idea. Now
  > Now it's more important to just start and move.
  > Adjust as you go. Continuously iterate.
  > Learn in public. Share progress. Adapt in real time.
  > The future belongs to those who can act without having all the answers.

  > ## High-impact communication
  >
  > Whether you're talking to a person or prompting a model, the better you can translate ideas into words, the more you'll get out of it.
  > Being able to clearly articulate your thoughts, recommendations, and intentions is still a superpower-even
  > in the age of AI-so double down on it.

## Talk to the :duck:

  <br/>It seems that "rubber ducking" _might_ have started at Pixar??? :exploding_head:

## Random, but relevant, thoughts

> "To know what you are going to draw, you have to begin drawing."

-- Pablo Picasso (possibly apocryphal, but still good advice nonetheless!)

> “You’re only as good as you’re willing to be bad…The fact that you’re not going to be good at something or that you’re going to fail at something—that’s OK. Because you’re never going to get good unless you’re willing to be bad.”

-- Randall Stutman PhD, speech communication professor

> I see a lot of people with talent but the one thing they don’t have is that just love of doing it for the sake of it.

—- Rodney Mullen, pro skateboarder

> Competence is often less of a problem than confidence.
> An underrated aspect of doing anything hard is believing in yourself. Action creates both confidence and momentum.
> When action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on.
> A marathoner who hits a wall running at mile 5 doesn't focus on the end of the race; they focus on getting around the next corner. Then, the next corner.
> What's the smallest step you can take right now to make progress?
