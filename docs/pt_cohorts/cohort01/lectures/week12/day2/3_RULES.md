title: Three Rules for Junior Developers
---

If you’re a new developer, particularly if you’re on the job hunt, there are 3 rules you should be following:

1. Write code
2. Make Friends
3. Be Stubborn

## Write Code

Whether you have a job or not, _write code_! Developers write code, period, full stop. If you applied for a job and were told you didn't have enough experience in a language or tool, then GO WRITE SOMETHING WITH THAT LANGUAGE OR TOOL!

If you're not coding, you're not progressing. You don't need a job, or a class, or a certification program, to write code. Go back and rewrite an assignment using a different tech stack, write something that just sounds silly (eg. I've started a map of the planets in just HTML/CSS just to see if it can be done).

WRITE
CODE!

This isn't just a "Sean is crazy!" thought, give this episode of [The Changelog Podcast](https://changelog.com/friends/85#t=3732) a listen. I've linked to about the one-hour mark, where Justin Searls of Test Double offers some very similar advice.

Seriously, write code.  It will help more than anything else...

## Make Friends

Go to meet-ups!

Go and talk to people! Tell them about the silly new project you're working on (see Rule #1 above). Making friends helps with inspiration, motivation, and puts you in mind should someone know of an opportunity down the road.  You can't leverage a network if you don't have one.

Keep in mind, I say this as someone who is _not an extrovert_. Making friends can be really difficult, but the rewards are worth the risk.

## Be Stubborn

This is particularly important if you're on the job hunt.  If you're just doing a "spray and pray" by clicking buttons on LinkedIn then you're basically throwing resumes into the abyss. Try to find a person to talk to, if you get a rejection letter reach out and ask for action items you can work on. Some people might ghost you, that's just the way it goes.

To speak to the job search; I have a friend who wanted to move from design into development. He took some classes, including a Masters program from Georgia Tech, and just started working on some personal projects (see Rule #1).  He kept a spreadsheet of the number of applications he sent and the results of any interviews.  I don't remember the exact number, but I do remember that he had applied to well over 100 places.  A smaller number of those places gave him one or more interviews. Plenty of places just ghosted him, or rejeected him outright. Over a year later he landed his first job at a small startup.

This was in 2018, when the climate was much better than it has been recently. It was frustrating and demoralizing, but he kept going. He tailored his resume, wrote targeted cover letters, and reached out to as many actual humans as possible (see Rule #2).

This is what I mean by "being stubborn."  You have to keep at it, and stubbornly refuse to quit.  The job hunt is one of the few true binaries; you can either give up and wallow in self pity, _or_ you can stubbornly keep moving until you get to where you want to be. But it _has_ to be one or the other, you can't do both.  It's fine to be disappointed and take some time to regroup, but you can't live in that headspace and expect anything to change.

Also, if you haven't noticed my references to Rule #1 and Rule #2, the more you follow those rules, the _easier_ Rule #3 becomes.

Also, I said this was the "short version" of these thoughts. Imagine what the fuller version is going to look like :laughing:
