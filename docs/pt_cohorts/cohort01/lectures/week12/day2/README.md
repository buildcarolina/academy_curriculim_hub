## 3 Rules

The job hunt will start soon, and it is _never_ not difficult (double negative intended).

10 years ago, it was a little easier. But, even then, it might involve 100s of interviews, being ghosted, immediate rejections, and an absurd number of interview rounds before you got hired.

The market in 2023, 2204, and 2025 has been the strangest I've seen in my entire career.  AI also adds in a wrinkle to this.  Literally _no one_ can promise you a job (and if they do, make sure it's _after_ you've signed the paperwork to become an employee!).  It is going to take a _lot_ of work.  To that end, I've put together [Three Rules for Junior Developers](./3_RULES.md) as a guideline to help you be proactive.

## React Router

React Router's current iteration introduces more than a few changes over previous versions.

We're going to follow along with the docs and add it to our Shrink Ray UI project.

Our goal is to make 3 routes, matching what's on [the Shrink Ray website](https://bzzt.vercel.app):

- Homepage
- Links page (view all links)
- Add a link page (we'll add functionality later)

We'll also be adding a `<Layout/>` component to handle those items that repeat on every page (i.e. `Header`, `Footer`)

Current status can be found in the [Shrink Ray UI Repo](https://github.com/seanrreid/shrinkray_ui)

## Guidance

- I wrote some high-level guidelines regarding [how to write React apps](/docs/lessons/react/react-guidelines/)
- I also wrote a [Cheatsheet of common React patterns](./CHEATSHEET.md)
