- [Letâ€™s learn how modern JavaScript frameworks work by building one](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/12/02/lets-learn-how-modern-javascript-frameworks-work-by-building-one/)
  <br/>This is actually high on my personal list to try out...it's super compelling to dig into the "how" of the tools we're using.

## Styling Options (React and beyond...)

:::tip
There are positives and negatives to all of the approaches/libraries that I list below.

Frameworks come and go regularly (eg. the path I used to recommend is no longer recommended, and [another popular library, that started in 2020, is no longer being maintained](https://github.com/stitchesjs/stitches/discussions/1149#discussioncomment-6223090)).

Before going deep into any specific _tool_, make sure you understand the core of the _language!_ Tailwind could disappear tomorrow, but CSS has been relatively stable as a language for decades.

- [A Thorough Analysis of CSS-in-JS](https://css-tricks.com/a-thorough-analysis-of-css-in-js/)
  <br/> This is from 2021, but it's still fairly accurate of the ecosystem in general.
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) as I said in class, this is my personal preference.
- Previously, I've recommended [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). However, since React 18, this approach isn't recommended.
- Another popular option would be [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).
  <br/>Tailwind is known as a "utility-first" approach to css. It's a framework that generates CSS based on classes applied to elements.

## React

- [The State of React and the Community in 2025](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2025/06/react-community-2025/?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
- [React.dev: `<StrictMode>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode)
  <br/>This reference explains a bit about why components load twice in Development mode!
- [Fetching Data in React with useEffect](https://maxrozen.com/fetching-data-react-with-useeffect)
  > This is why useEffect is the hook for us - by fetching data, we're making our React component impure, and useEffect provides us a safe place to write impure code.

## Worth a Read

- [One Thing Better: How to Recover When You Mess Up](https://jasonfeifer.beehiiv.com/p/you-messed-up-now-here-s-how-to-regain-your-confidence)
- [The Subversive Hyperlink](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/)
  <br/>, I'll add this to the "everything old is new again" pile. Back in the "walled garden" internt days ruled by services like Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe, the HTML Link was revolutionary. Now, in the age of Twitter, Facebook, and App Stores, it's interesting to see someone shine the light on the topic again.

  <br/>My hatred of the "Dark Mode" variant of this site is directly proportional to how much I _love_ the message of this site.
