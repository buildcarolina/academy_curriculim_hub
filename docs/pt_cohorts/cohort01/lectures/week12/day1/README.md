## Do cool things

> "I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things, and none of them bother me. All the mistakes, and all the dopey things, and all the times I was embarrassed — they don't matter. What matters is that I can kind of look back and say: Pretty much any time I got the chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it — and that's where my solace comes from.

## The story so far...

If you missed last week, you can catch up by forking and cloning the [Shrink Ray React App Repo](https://github.com/buildcarolina/shrinkray_ui_react_2025)

## Part 1: CSS in React (and other frameworks, kinda)

[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is my personal preference, primarily because it allows us to focus on just writing CSS.

Thankfully, Vite makes this work "out of the box," so it will be our demo for today.

## Part 2: React Router

React Router's current iteration introduces more than a few changes over previous versions.

We're goign to follow along with the docs and add it to our Shrink Ray UI project.

### React Router 5 demo

:::info

I'm sharing this to show the previous patterns used in React Router. _Some_ of these carry over into how we'll be using React Router 7, and you'll likely see them used in a variety of tutorials or ChatGPT examples.

React Router moves _quickly_ and I've had major version changes 3 or 4 times now over the course of teaching it.
