> "I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things, and none of them bother me. All the mistakes, and all the dopey things, and all the times I was embarrassed — they don't matter. What matters is that I can kind of look back and say: Pretty much any time I got the chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it — and that's where my solace comes from.

## Notes on the Terminal

What's the difference between `bash` and `zsh`?

`bash`

- By default, the prompt for a regular user typically ends with a dollar sign `$`
- Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions, and macOS before Catalina (10.15)

`zsh`

- By default, the prompt for a regular user often ends with a percent sign `%`
- ZSH is newer, and incorporates features from Bash, KornShell (ksh), and tcsh.
- ZSH became the default shell for macOS starting with Catalina (10.15).
- There is a rich plugin ecosystem via tools like [Oh my ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- (according to Gemini) "It's often considered more user-friendly for interactive use out-of-the-box."

How do I know which shell I have?

- Type the command `echo $0`, `-bash` means bash shell and `-zsh` means zsh

## Setting up our environments

- Let's setup screen sharing for everyone!
- VSCode setup, specifically the `code` command
- Install `git`
- Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Connecting to Github

:movie_camera: There's a video walkthrough here: [Connecting Git & Github](/docs/resources/connecting_git_github)

The video references information that's in the following articles:

- [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

## Python

- [Python 3.13.3 Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3133/)
  <br/>We'll download the "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer"

Side note: When the last winter cohort installed Python it was version 3.11.9...things don't stop!
