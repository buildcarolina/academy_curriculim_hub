## Git

- [GitLab vs GitHub : Key Differences in 2025](https://spacelift.io/blog/gitlab-vs-github)
  <br/>Both are cloud services that store repositories remotely, but there are _some_ differences in each service.
  <br/>Fair warning, part of the review is a promotion for a product put out by the company who wrote the article.
- [I struggled with Git, so I'm making a game to spare others the pain](https://initialcommit.com/blog/im-making-a-git-game?utm_source=tldrwebdev)
  <br/>The game itself looks like its in pre-release, but the story behind it is really interesting.
  <br/>Read through and check out the demos, and, if interested, subscribe to get updates when the game is ready!
  <br/>(As an added bonus, there is some overlap with Python! :snake:)
