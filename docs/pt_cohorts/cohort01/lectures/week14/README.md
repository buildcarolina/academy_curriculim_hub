title: Week 14 - Backend, SQL, FastAPI
---

We're about three quarters of the way through the course!  During the next few weeks we will be taking a short break from frontend and JavaScript to start working with backend development.

This week we'll work with PSQL databases, and then next week we'll be introducted to FastAPI, connecting the database to code in order to generate RESTful APIs.
