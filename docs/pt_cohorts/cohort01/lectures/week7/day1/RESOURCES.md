## Fun

- [Internet Artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/)
  <br/>I can't necessarily explain this without spoiling it, so give it a click and see how many hours you lose in the process :wink:

## General

- [Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Programming: Key Similarities and Differences](https://www.mendix.com/blog/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-programming/)
- [The End of Front-End Development](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/)
  <br/>The title seems ominous, but don't let that dissuade you. This is a good examination of the role AI might play in frontend development.
- [Visualizing Frontend Architecture](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/17/)
- [Essays on programming I think about a lot](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/)
  <br/>This list has been making the rounds on many news sites I read. It's a fantastic collection by the author!
- [CodeAcademy: What is REST?](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest)
  <br/>
  > JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.

## HTTP

- [Understanding the Basics of HTTP Status Codes](https://dev.to/vidyarathna/understanding-the-basics-of-http-status-codes-40b9)
  <br/>This will come in handy as we continue to work with the `request`/`response` cycle.

## CSS

- [Old Dogs, new CSS Tricks](https://mxb.dev/blog/old-dogs-new-css-tricks/)

- [Replacing jQuery with Vanilla ES6](https://aarontgrogg.com/blog/2021/09/29/replacing-jquery-with-vanilla-es6/)
- [HTML "self-awareness" with sibling indexing in JavaScript](https://dev.to/cassidoo/html-self-awareness-with-sibling-indexing-in-javascript-2p94)
  <br/>This is almost more of a thought experiment than a practical application. BUT, it's a really interesting experiment in building with _just_ JavaScript + HTML

## Fetch

### _Go Make Things_ on `xhr` vs `fetch`

- [How to use the Fetch API with vanilla JS](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-use-the-fetch-api-with-vanilla-js/)
- Read this article to see the [author's previous thoughts on `xhr` vs `fetch`](https://gomakethings.com/why-i-still-use-xhr-instead-of-the-fetch-api/) and notice the transtion from one year to the next.
