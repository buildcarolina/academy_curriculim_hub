title: Week 15 - Backend, SQL, FastAPI
---

We're about 3/4 of the way through the cohort.  This week we are still taking a short break from frontend and JavaScript to continue working with backend development.

This week we'll connect our PSQL databases to our FastAPI code and generate RESTful APIs.  In the next couple of weeks we'll bring our frontend skill back into the picture and connect the full stack.
