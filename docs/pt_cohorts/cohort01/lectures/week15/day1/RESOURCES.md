**Spoiler**: It _wasn't_ a "ChatGPT mistake." It was a "rushing through a poorly thought out, last minute, decision, and not having proper precautions in place mistake." The "ChatGPT" parts of this error were _very_ small. Overall, it's a good lesson in properly reviewing your code and getting multiple eyes on it before you launch!

It's also a reminder to **NOTE OVERCOMPLICATE THINGS!**
