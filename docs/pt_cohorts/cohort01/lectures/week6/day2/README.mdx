## Presentations

- [Javascript Scope and Callbacks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HcnsTdZIBk0SE83Mf_LOb0UKrOyvW2w01lyoYVcjL0s/edit?usp=sharing)

## In Class Exercise

- We're going to fork and clone this repo: [DOM Shopping List](https://github.com/seanrreid/DOM-shopping-list)
- Then we'll do a "to do list" code along, focusing on DOM building + Scope

### Other Notes

- [`append()` vs `appendChild()`](https://dev.to/ibn_abubakre/append-vs-appendchild-a4m)
  <br/>TL;DR -> `append()` can append text _or_ a Node, `appendChild()` can _only_ append a Node

From Gemini re: synchronized vs synchronous:

> Synchronized: The "-ized" suffix often implies an action that has been made to happen in coordination. In "synchronized swimming," multiple swimmers perform the same routines at the same time. The focus is on the parallel execution of identical or highly similar actions. It's about bringing multiple independent entities into a shared temporal framework for a unified effect. You could also have synchronized clocks (multiple clocks showing the same time simultaneously) or synchronized data (multiple copies of data updated at the same time).
>
> Synchronous: The "-ous" suffix often describes a state of existing or occurring at the same time. When we say something is "synchronous," it means events are happening in a coordinated sequence or dependently on each other in time. It's less about multiple identical things happening together and more about different parts of a single process or related processes happening in a specific temporal relationship. For example, in synchronous communication, the sender and receiver are active at the same time, often in a back-and-forth exchange. In synchronous data transfer, each piece of data is sent and acknowledged before the next is transmitted.
