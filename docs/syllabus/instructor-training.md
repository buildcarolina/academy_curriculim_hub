# Instructor Training

## Overview

This guide will help you get started as an instructor with DigitalCrafts. It contains practical information about things like managing a classroom, assigning coding exercises, and how to contribute to our teaching materials.

More importantly, we hope it orients you to our teaching philosophy, which has grown organically over time through our experiences helping hundreds of students change their lives, as well as their careers.

## 1: Teaching Class

The DigitalCrafts classroom is distinctly different from a traditional classroom. Though a portion of your day is spent lecturing, your primary goal is to prepare your students for hands-on practice. During lecture periods, you'll demonstrate tools and techniques, demystify industry jargon, and break regularly to assign short training activities.

You don't have to do it alone! Your teaching assistants (known throughout DigitalCrafts as Developers in Residence, or DIRs) have been through the program and are the "first responders" when your students need help. Make sure to delegate tasks to them as needed.

Whether your students are in the same room as you or miles away, you'll be able to provide the best training experience for each of them. Recordings, on-screen annotation tools, and private breakout rooms are some of the teaching and collaboration features that you'll master.

## 2. Exercises, Projects & Homework

Most of the real learning will happen for your students when they are working independently or in groups. During these times, you'll serve more as a mentor and facilitator - not an active participant in their code. It's important to give a struggling student just enough guidance to find their own breakthrough.

To help guide your students over the weeks and months, they need individual feedback on their coding practices and problem solving. Meeting with each of them 1-1 to talk about their code isn't sustainable, given the number of students in a cohort. You'll learn how to provide short, effective feedback in the form of recorded code review.

Every instructor has a distinct teaching style. At the same time, we want our students to benefit from the body of teaching material built up over the years. The Learning Portal is a resource that you can use to orient yourself to unfamiliar topics, assign as reading for students who want to get a head start, and serve as a reference for students looking to catch up.

These lessons will help you empower your students to make the most of their time spent reading, writing, debugging code.

- Guidance and Debugging
- Recording Feedback
- Using the Learning Portal

## 3: Contributing Content

We do our best to tailor our instruction and our materials to best serve our students. If you discover a need for better/additional content, please make them available to other instructors!

Here are some lessons on creating content that is easily shared and in a format that is used by the rest of the instructor team.
