This is loosely structured to line up for 9 weeks of lecture, followed by 3 weeks for the Capstone Project.
There are 9 sections. However, it's important to note that each section doesn't necessarily correspond to a week. Some content will be shorter than one week, others will be longer.

## 9. Full Stack

### Put it all together

Welcome to CRUDCo, Inc! Let's build rad stuff!

CRUDCo Inc has been hired to write a URL shortening service for a client.

#### Requirments

- Users can submit a long URL.
- URLs are saved in a database.
- Unique IDs are generated for each URL.
- The short url is available via a list when a user logs in.

#### To discuss

- What relationships do we need to create (aka "What is our schema?")?
- What is our Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
- What are all the parts we'll need to build out the MVP?
