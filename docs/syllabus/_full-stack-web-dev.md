## Graduation Requirements

Throughout the 16-week program, students will be evaluated on their progression and career readiness. Students will undergo at least 2 performance reviews throughout the program to ensure each student is progressing steadily throughout the course and to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. In order to receive a certificate of completion, students must meet the follow criteria by the end of their cohort.

- Miss no more than 7 days of class ‚Äì Students who miss more than 7 days (excused or unexcused) will not receive a certificate of completion, career support, or be able to participate in student graduation. Students who miss more than 20% of the program or 10 consecutive days will be removed from the program.
- Demonstrate an understanding of key concepts ‚Äì Students must demonstrate their understanding of the key concepts covered throughout the program in their Capstone Project. Key concepts include Programming Fundamentals, Front End Development, Back End Development, Programming Best Practices, and Git.
- Develop key assets needed for the job search ‚Äì Students must develop and receive a "pass" for their resume and portfolio before completion of their cohort.

### Additional Resources

It's easy to get overwhelmed by all of the lingo and jargon that developers use. Our advice: get acclimated as quickly as possible by listening to podcasts.

At first, you'll feel _more_ overwhelmed, but a funny thing happens after a couple of months - you'll suddenly realize that you actually know what they're talking about!

Here are some of our favorites.

- [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) features interviews with people about their journey into the tech industry. Full of friendly advice, and especially good when your [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is flaring up.
- [ladybug](https://www.ladybug.dev/) offers a smart and insightful look at the tech industry. Hosted by three women, they chat with guests about technology, career development, books, and dev life.
- [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/) discusses all of the non-coding aspects of being an engineer, such as pay raises, technical leadership, and getting promoted. :100:
- [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a short-format podcast (~25 minutes) in which the hosts chat about news from the world of Python. (Highly recommended, since the Python ecosystem intersects with so many fields, such as cybersecurity, finance, DevOps, data science, etc.)
- [base.cs](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) is another podcast from the folks at CodeNewbie, but is a limited series that covers computer science concepts from the ground up. It's a fun introduction that's great for beginners.

In addition to these podcasts, we link to other relevant resources throughout the syllabus.

## 7. Backend Foundations

Up to now, you've only worked with half of the web - the half that works in the browser. To create web pages that allow for collaboration between users (multiplayer games, social media sites, etc.), you will need to write code that runs on the server. To get started, you will create a simple web server (yes, a web server!) using Node.js.

Just like JavaScript on the browser, there are a number of handy libraries that you can use. You will learn to install and manage those using the npm command that comes with Node.js.

One of these libraries will let you use WebSockets for building real-time applications. As an exercise, you'll build the backend and front-end of a chat application.

### Learning Objectives

- Node JS
  - Use npm to install packages and write scripts
  - Creating modules
  - Use built-in modules
  - Import third-party modules
- Express JS
  - Learn the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern
  - Use routing and middleware
  - Secure HTTP headers with Helmet
  - Create views with the Pug templating language
  - Authenticate users with Passport and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Use WebSockets for data streams

### Technologies

- Node.js
  - Express 4
    - Templating with `express-es6-template-engine`
    - Helmet (for security)
    - Passport (for authentication)

### Lessons

- [Node 101](/lessons/back-end-foundations/node-101/)
- [Express 101](/lessons/back-end-foundations/express-101/)
- [Express Template Engine](/lessons/back-end-foundations/express-template-engine/)
- [Express Middleware](/lessons/back-end-foundations/express-middleware/)

### Additional Resources

- [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/) is a newsletter about JavaScript on the front-end and the backend. Helps you keep an eye on the latest and greatest in the JavaScript world.
- [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/) has some overlap with JavaScript Weekly, but is geared more towards backend technologies.
- [StatusCode Weekly](https://weekly.statuscode.com/) covers news from web application development, server infrastructure, browser technologies, and more!

## 8. Databases

At the heart of any blog, a social media site, or collaborative web app is its database. Often, your data will have complex relationships ("a blog post has an author and one or more comments from a registered user"). Dealing with this data is straightforward, as long as you can speak the language. This week, you will learn how to "talk" to a database using SQL (Structured Query Language).

As your backend code gets larger and more complex, you will need ways to store data, organize your code, and develop quickly. This week you'll be using the Express.js framework, a minimalist backend framework that will help you write backend code. You'll learn how to take advantage of Express.js's routing, templating, and session management.

### Learning Objectives

- Data modeling
  - Create tables that describe a problem domain
  - Apply database normalization when creating tables
  - Use primary keys, foreign keys, and linking tables to model relationships between tables
- Querying
  - Modify the contents of database tables by inserting, updating, and deleting
  - Efficiently retrieve data by selecting, filtering, grouping, and joining data from tables
- Database management
  - Modify the structure of tables
  - Optimize databases with indexes
  - Export and import data

## 9. Full Stack Project

Using the knowledge you‚Äôve gained over the past few weeks, you will work in groups to build a full-stack web application with a functioning front and back end.

## 10. Career Prep

Career Prep consists of three class days dedicated to preparing your career assets and training for the job search. During this time there will be no technical aspects of class as led by your instructor. Your DiRs will be available to help with technical aspects of creating and hosting your portfolio, and the Student Success team will be available for the rest. Students will prepare for the job search during Career Prep and throughout the program by:

1. Creating an engaging online presence.
2. Crafting a professional resume.
3. Building a unique portfolio of projects.
4. Participating in Algorithm Fridays to prepare for technical interviews.
5. Completing a mock technical interview with a Senior SWE in the industry (in real time).

### Learning Objectives

At DigitalCrafts, we want our builders to feel ready for the job search before they finish our bootcamp. In order to do this, we provide students with an understanding on how to build successful resources to stand out to employers and ensure quality across all job assets, for example:

- How to create a consistent online presence which stands out to employers
- How to create a resume highlighting your past experience and work in class
- How to highlight your development work to employers on your personal portfolio
- How to negotiate your salary after receiving an offer
- Best practices on interviewing

If this is your first time composing a resume or a portfolio, we recommend that you take a dive and learn some best practice for your career assets. Please refer to lessons shared below for a step-by-step guide to building your job search resources.

This syllabus outlines the Student Success Team‚Äôs recommendations for you as you begin your job search (or later down the road). Our lessons also cover many frequently asked questions, such as:

- Q: Should I use a template for my portfolio?
- Q: Should I put my whole address on my resume?
- Q: How can I make my github profile more interesting?

‚Ä¶And more!

### Lessons

In each lesson, we have prepared detailed guidelines for what we believe are essential elements to include in all these career assets. Below you will find various lessons focused on building your career assets, best practices, additional resources and a step-by-step guide to content creation.
