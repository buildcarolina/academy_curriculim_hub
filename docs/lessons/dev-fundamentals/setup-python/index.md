Python is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by web developers, scientists, digital artists, and security experts.

It originated as a language for teaching beginners, but designed to be a powerful tool in the hands of a professional. We use it in class because:

- Its syntax is clear and simple compared to other languages
- It forces you to format your code well
- The error messages are descriptive (and easily used in a Google search!)

There is a good chance that Python3 is already installed on your computer. To check, type this in a bash terminal:

```sh
which python3
```

You might see output similar to the following:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/python3
```

If there is no output (and it just shows you your prompt again), please follow the installation instructions in this guide.

:::danger Python2 is no longer supported
Though you can run many (but not all) of the code samples using Python2, it is not recommended.

- Support ended in January 2020
  - i.e., It no longer receves bug fixes or security updates
- It contains language design flaws fixed by Python3

If you choose to use Python2, you won't be able to follow all of the code examples as shown in the Learning Portal. There will be times you'll need to translate from Python3 to Python2. (Be prepared to do some extra debugging!)

## Installing Python

There are a few different ways to install Python, and a few specific options for various operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux). However, for our purposes, the easiest solution is to use the default Python installer.

That can be [downloaded here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download the file to your local machine and run the installer.
