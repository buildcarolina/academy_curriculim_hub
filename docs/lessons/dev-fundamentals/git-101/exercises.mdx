title: Git 101 Exercises
description: Git 101 Exercises
---

To solidify your knowledge, here are a set of exercises that will require you to use the techniques you've just learned in the lesson.

They are organized into _small_, _medium_, and _large_ sized problems. The small exercises will be very similar to the examples in the lesson. If you get stuck, refer to the relevant section in the lesson. The medium exercises will require you to combine concepts. The lesson may not have a single, specific example for you to reference. The large exercises are more open-ended and may require you to search the web for additional material.

## Small

### 1. Visualizing git

[Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) is a tool for visualizing how commits and branches work. Use it to go through the commands used in this lesson and see how they work.

### 2. Hello again, git

In this exercise, you'll create a git repository, add a file, and view the log.
As you're working, it's a good idea to check the status regularly using `git status`.

Create a new directory and initialize it as a git repository.

Create at least one file to commit.

When you are finished, the output of `git status` should look like this:

```sh
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

And the `git log` should contain at least one commit:

```sh
commit 5973f218e644367487135b828aa271441a90f13f (HEAD -> master)
Author: Your Name <your@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 09:37:19 2020 -0500

    adds cheerful greeting
```
<details>
    <summary>
        This solution only creates a single file and makes one commit. Your solution might have more!
    </summary>

    ```sh
    # Create a new directory and cd into it
    mkdir hello-again
    cd hello-again

    # Create the repo
    git init

    # Check the status
    git status

    # Create a new file and put some text in it
    touch hello.txt
    echo 'Hi there!' > hello.txt

    # Check the status again...
    git status

    # Add and commit the file
    git add hello.txt
    git commit -m 'adds cheerful greeting'

    # Check the status and the log
    git status
    git log
    ```
</details>

### 3. The more the merrier

This exercise is similar to the first one. Make sure you create a new directory for the repo. (And **do not** put it inside the other repo!)

Create a new repo. In this repo, you'll create three files. For each one:

1. Put some text in it.
2. `git add` it to the staging area.
3. `git commit` it to the repo

Then, delete one of the files and _commit the change_ to the repo.

When you are finished, the output of `git status` should look like this:

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

And the log should have at least four commits:

```
commit f2fa8dccf377182a9bd8a503d04346c447a8c47b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Your Name <your@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 09:58:11 2020 -0500

    deletes file

commit a99c55550f55a2e5cb4fc643f7422a1db9cdd9f4
Author: Your Name <your@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 09:58:11 2020 -0500

    adds third file

commit 05a617c47375c34045b2eca18019a386538f989a
Author: Your Name <your@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 09:58:11 2020 -0500

    adds second file

commit 42931a222cc59ffd1ad968e7d7e3a04c50818181
Author: Your Name <your@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 09:58:11 2020 -0500

    adds first file
```

As you work, use `ls` and `cat` to confirm that the files exist and contain the text you expect.

:::details Solution

```sh
# Create a new directory and cd into it
mkdir the-more-the-merrier
cd the-more-the-merrier

# Create the repo
git init

# Check the status
git status

# Create a new file with some text
# (echo will create the file if it doesn't exist)
echo 'testing testing...' > first.txt

# Check the status
git status

# Add the file
git add first.txt

# Commit the file
git commit -m 'adds first file'

# Add another file
echo 'another file' > second.txt
git add second.txt

# Check the status
git status

# Commit the file
git commit -m 'adds second file'

# Create, add, and commit a third file
echo 'one more file!' > third.txt
git add third.txt
git commit -m 'adds third file'

# Delete a file
rm second.txt

# Check the status
git status

# Add the change
git add second.txt

# Commit the change
git commit -m 'deletes file'

# Check the status and the log
git status
git log
```

## Medium

### 1. Undo! Undo!

Create a new repo and create three files. Add and commit the files one at a time.

Delete one of the files and commit the change.

_Undo the last commit_ by using the `git revert` command. (Refer to the [Undoing changes](/docs/lessons/dev-fundamentals/git-101/#undoing-changes) section of the lesson for details.)

When you are finished, you should have a clean working tree and `git log` should show at least four commits. The most recent one should be a revert.

```

    Revert "removes advice"

git add one.txt
git commit -m 'begins a story'

echo 'two heads are better than one' > two.txt
git add two.txt
git commit -m 'adds good advice'

echo 'three is a magic number' > three.txt
git add three.txt
git commit -m 'reveals a secret'

# Check the status and the log
git status
git log

# Delete a file...
rm two.txt
# And commit the change
git add two.txt
git commit -m 'removes advice'

# Undo the last commit

### 2. Different branches, different worlds

Create a new repo. Create, add, and commit a file called `original.txt`.

Then, create a new branch called `alternate-branch`. Switch to the new branch and then:

1. Delete `original.txt`
2. Commit the change
3. Create, add, and commit a second file called `new.txt`

When you are finished, `git status` should print "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

When on the `master` branch, the log should look like this:

```
commit 3def7b4ff3c6079b0833dc1d428963606a899b47 (master)
Author: Your Name <you@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 11:03:32 2020 -0500

    adds original file
```

On the `alternate` branch, the log should look like this:

```
commit 0121c0260c633e8b6bec158a2afe778ca82e026d (HEAD -> alternate-branch)
Author: Your Name <you@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 11:04:19 2020 -0500

    adds new file

commit dadeebd254ce6c8f6a4947de917cb89f0d9eed91
Author: Your Name <you@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 11:04:00 2020 -0500

    deletes original file

commit 3def7b4ff3c6079b0833dc1d428963606a899b47 (master)
Author: Your Name <you@email.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 16 11:03:32 2020 -0500

    adds original file

```

:::details Solution

```sh
# Create repo
mkdir different-worlds
cd different-worlds
git init

# Check the status
git status

# Create, add, and commit original.txt
echo 'this is the first file' > original.txt
git add original.txt
git commit -m 'adds original file'

# Create a new branch
git branch alternate-branch

# Switch to new branch
git checkout alternate-branch

# Delete original.txt and commit the change
rm original.txt
git add original.txt
git commit -m 'deletes original file'

# Create, add, and commit new.txt
echo 'a brand new file' > new.txt
git add new.txt
git commit -m 'adds new file'

# Check which branch you are on
git branch

# Check the status and the log
git status
git log

# Switch back to master branch
git checkout master

# Check the branch, status, and log
git branch
git status
git log
```
