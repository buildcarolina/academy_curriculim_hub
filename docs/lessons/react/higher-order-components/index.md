# Higher Order Components

:::danger Tell Chris to DELETE THIS before publishing

This is more theoretical and sets them up for understanding React Router

It comes back to what a Component actually is:

- It's a "renderable"
- It can be a function or an instance of React.Component
    - if a function, it returns a React Element
    - if instanceof React.Component, has a render() that returns a React Element

What's a React Element?

- it's different from a DOM Element.
- it's a plain Object (key-value pairs) that describe a DOM Element.
    - it has a `type`
    - it has props

Examples of Higher Order Components include:

- a Component that receives and renders a Component
    - no changes
    - maybe it just logs the props nicely
- a Component that adds or modifies props
-
