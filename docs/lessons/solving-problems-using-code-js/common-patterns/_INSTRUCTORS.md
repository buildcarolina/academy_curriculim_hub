# Questions you might get from students

## Aren't there built-in functions for finding an item in an Array or String?

Yes, and it's important to know that it's not "magic" - that the built-in function is probably implementing an algorithm similar to the one taught in the lesson.

The built-in function exists because it's a common problem, not because it's a hard problem.

And there are times when the built-in functions aren't designed to solve the exact problem you're encountering.

Being able to "shift into a lower gear" is an important skill for a developer.
