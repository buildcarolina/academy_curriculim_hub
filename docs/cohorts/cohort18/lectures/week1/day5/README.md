## Extra Practice

### Python

Here are some additional review exercises via the [Google for Education: Python course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up).

There are videos you can watch to go deeper into any particular area. There are also [exercises](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/basic) that grow in complexity. Some of similar to things we've already done, others are good challenge to level up your skills.

### Git + Github

Flavio Copes [Valley of Code](https://thevalleyofcode.com/) has some great resources to reviewing [how to use `git`](https://thevalleyofcode.com/git) and [working with Github](https://thevalleyofcode.com/github).
