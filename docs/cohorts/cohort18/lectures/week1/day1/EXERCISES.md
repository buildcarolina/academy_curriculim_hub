## Practice

### Command Line Crash Course

Please go to [The Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) (Appendix A of "Learn Python the Hard Way") and

* Task 1: Review Exercise 1.
* Task 2: Exercises: 2-3.
* Task 3: Exercises 4-7.
* Task 4: Exercises 9-11.

They'll help reinforce the concepts and (more importantly) your muscle memory for using the Terminal.

### Terminus

Please run through the Terminus command-line game. You play in the browser using terminal commands. It limits you to a very few commands, but it's a good exercise.

### Dungeons and Directories

> Dungeons and Directories is a short text adventure game that you play in your file browser.

[Dungeons and Directories](https://wheybags.com/dungeons_and_directories/)

Download the proper version for your OS (mostly likely OSX, aka MacOS). If you're on a Mac you might need to right-click (2 finger click) and select "Open" from the menu and verify you want to run the app. MacOS will block the app by default otherwise.

## On your own

### Make a Folder

* Open your termingl, and make sure you are in your home directory. Remember, you can use `pwd` to see your current directory. It should say something like `/Users/yourUsernam`
* In your home directory, create a folder called `Repos` or `Repositories`.
* Change into that folder and create a folder called `week1`.
* Change into your `week1` folder and run `git init`
* Hold that until tomorrow, we'll pick up from there.

### Write a Week 1, Day 1 Journal

* Move into the `repositories` folder we created in class
* Make a new folder called `journal`
* Make a file named `week1day1.md` (this is a Markdown file, you can treat it like a text file!)
* Edit the file and write about Day 1, i.e. how are you feeling after the first morning?
