Take the starter code of the RPG game and rewrite it using objects.
It's currently written in a procedural fashion, with a series of `while` loops and conditionals.

You're task is to refactor it and use objects/classes.

Instructions can be found in the [Python RPG folder](/docs/exercises/python-rpg/)
