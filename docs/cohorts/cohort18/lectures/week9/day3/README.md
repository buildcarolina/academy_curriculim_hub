## CRUDCo

Let's have our user's _actually_ be able to login.

### Review

- Code Review
  - What worked?
  - Where are you stuck?
- Check our Models
- Verify migrations
- Test our API to add/update URLs via Swagger
- Add users model
- Alter an existing table
- Add in JWT and Authentication

### Next Steps

- Protect `POST` requests
  - Protect `GET` requests as well? Or allow "read only?"
- Add some users and data
- Continue work on frontend
  - Build forms to login
  - Build forms to submit a new URL
- Handle the _actual_ redirection!
