Implementing MVC in FastAPI:

FastAPI's route handlers essentially act as controllers

### Schools -> Courses -> Students

We're going to look at `JOIN` statements, and a many-to-many relationship.

To do this, we'll create a database for Crud University. It will involve the following steps:

1. Create a database called `crud_university`
2. Create a `schema.sql` file and define three tables
  - `students`
  - `courses`
  - `enrollments`
3. Create a `seed.sql` file with some test data.

#### Run some queries!

1. List _all_ students.
2. List _all_ courses.
3. List all _enrolled_ students.
4. List all the enrolled students by name _and_ the courses in which they're enrolled.

Start the PSQL terminal:

```sh
psql
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE some_school_name;

-- REMEMBER TO CONNECT TO THE DATABASE
\c some_school_name

CREATE TABLE students (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- many-to-many,
-- Enrollments tracks students & courses
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)
);

-- Let's use a JOIN statement to handle our lookup
SELECT
  students.name,
  courses.name
FROM enrollments
INNER JOIN students
  ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
INNER JOIN courses
  ON courses.id = enrollments.course_id;
```

## Comparing CRUD, Routes, and SQL Commands

This table illustrates how a usual CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application corresponds to application routes, and ultimately the SQL statements that might be triggered by those routes.

| CRUD   | ROUTES | SQL    |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CREATE | POST   | INSERT |
| READ   | GET    | SELECT |
| UPDATE | PUT    | UPDATE |
| DELETE | DELETE | DELETE |
