## Start here

- Complete the [FastAPI Starter Exercise](/docs/exercises/fastapi-starter/)

## Revenge of the Topic/Ranking project!

Remember the [exercise from Day 2](/docs/cohorts/cohort18/lectures/week5/day2/EXERCISES#project-overview)?

It's time to put that information into a database!

- Generate two files: `schema.sql` and `seed.sql`
  - `schema.sql` will contain the schema for two tables, `topic` and `ranking` (i.e. this will include the column titles from the exercise)
  - `seed.sql` will contain the data to populate those tables (i.e. this is most likely what you put into an array)
  - :alert: DON'T FORGET YOUR PRIMARY KEYS!!
- Create a database called `class_survey`
- Import your schema
- Import your seed data

## Stay tuned!

Next week, we're going to connect these all the things! #Voltron
