## Thoughts on Code Complexity

![Code Complexity](./img/code_complexity.jpg)

## First exercise

:::warning
SOMETHING IS BUSTED
:::

- Fork _then_ Clone this repo: [Busted Chuck](https://github.com/seanrreid/busted_chuck_norris)
- Get together as a group and fix it!

<!-- The solution is in [this repo](https://github.com/seanrreid/working_chuck_norris) -->

## Refactoring Chuck

- Upgrading with `async/await`
- Replace functions with Arrow functions

## Food for thought

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
