## Retro

We're going to do a [retrospective](/docs/lessons/front-end-foundations/project-management-101/#scrum) on the music app

- We'll be using a [EasyRetro](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/mprhKPu7nQV2hfN3xnhBHsG5hA92/ed4e06bb-e3e9-451a-a923-42ebdac868b7) (click the link to the join the retro board)
- We'll follow the [Starfish Retrospective Pattern](https://agileretrospectives.org/en/blog/starfish-exercise) to answer what we should:
  - Keep Doing
  - Do Less Of
  - Do More Of
  - Start Doing
  - Stop Doing
- You'll add any relevant thoughts for the various columns (it's fine if you don't have a thought for a column)
- You can vote for items that resonate with you.

You can read about how EasyRetro recommends [running a retrospective](https://easyretro.io/blog/how-to-run-a-basic-retrospective-using-funretro/).

## Recommended Reading

- [How to Find Open Source Projects to Contribute To](https://opensauced.pizza/docs/community-resources/how-to-find-open-source-projects-to-contribute-to/)
  <br/>This might help provide some guidance when you're looking for projects to add to your portfolio.
- [Three Laws of Software Complexity (or: why software engineers are always grumpy)](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2024/05/08/2024-ThreeLaws.html)
  <br/>Amusingly, this was part of a newsletter I recieved this week, and had a shout out to [Gall's Law](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Galls_law>), which was referenced in [yesterday's reading](/docs/cohorts/cohort18/lectures/week5/day2/#food-for-thought).
- [The most valuable software developer skills to get hired now](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3583931/the-most-valuable-software-developer-skills.html)
  <br/>**NOTE**: This is a couple years old, so some of the data is going to be out of date. But, there is some high-level guidance that remains valid.

  > Stack Overflow asked thousands of developers how frequently they learn a new language or framework for its 2020 Developer Survey, with around **75% of respondents saying they learn a new technology at least once a year**.

  (_emphasis added_)

- [Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard](https://medium.com/@andrewlatta/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard-303eae632820)
  > [Quincy] was convinced that the seemingly normal programmers I ran into were actually sociopaths who had experienced, then repressed, the trauma of learning to code.
