## Ask Me Anything

We're almost at the halfway point, and things aren't slowing down! Today, we'll spend most of our time debugging and doing an "Ask Me Anything."

If there's a particular topic you're frustrated by, or something you're stuck on, today is the day to ask!

Let's take a day to demystify and clarify things before we start to pick up more speed.

(Incidentally, according to my notes, it was the last day of Week 4 that I did this with the previous cohort.)

## Good Advice for Forward Progress:

> When you focus on the outcome, the gap between where you are and where you want to go seems large. To cover ground quickly, the tendency is to look for a hack or shortcut.
> The problem is that no one who got the outcomes you wanted used a hack or shortcut to get them. Instead, they consistently inched forward.
> Instead of focusing on the ultimate outcome, focus on the next move. There is always something you can do today to get a little better, to move a little closer, to put yourself in a better position. It's not pretty. It's not sexy. It's not fast. It doesn't even make for a good story. But it works.
> You don't build an empire in a day. You build it brick by brick. Day by day.
> Consistent daily progress for a long period of time.
