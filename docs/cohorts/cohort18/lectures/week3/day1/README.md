## Cohort 18 Arcade-o-Rama

![Pinky's Arcard in Taylors Mill](./img/pinkys_arcade.jpg)

We'll spend the first hour or so reviewing/playing everyone's Python games!

### Rules

- If your game is working, then the person presenting _after_ you will come up and play your game.
- If the game isn't working, then we'll debug as a group and _then_ the next person up will play.
- After playing a round, the player will present _their_ game, and the next person in line plays.
- The first person to present will play the last person's game.

## Presentations

## Types of programming

1. **Imperative programming** is writing code that tells the computer _how_ to do something.
   > "Hey, Computer, if a user gives you value [x] then perform action [y]."
2. **Decalartive programming** is writing code that tell the computer _what_ you want to see.
   > "Hey, Computer, this content needs to look like this..."
