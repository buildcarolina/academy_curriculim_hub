## General

- [30-plus years of HyperCard, the missing link to the Web](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/25-years-of-hypercard-the-missing-link-to-the-web/)

- [Kevin Powell CSS Articles](https://www.kevinpowell.co/articles/)
- [State of CSS 2023 Survey Results](https://2023.stateofcss.com/en-US/features/)
