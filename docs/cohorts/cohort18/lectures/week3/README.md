title: Week 3 - The Web, the Browser, HTML & CSS

During the second week we took a deeper dive into Python, in particular:

* Functions
* Object Oriented Programming (classes & objects)

This week we'll move on to the internet!

* How does the internet work? (Hint: it's all `request` and `response`)
* The browser and the Document Object Model (DOM)
* HTML + CSS + JavaScript
