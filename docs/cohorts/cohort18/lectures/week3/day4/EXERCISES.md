## Build your homepage, pt 3

Focus on the following items for Thursday:

- Add an HTML Form to accept user input
- Add some JavaScript to process the form input values
- Return a result to the user

## Build your SITE

Starting on Friday, add more pages!

- You decide how much more content to add, but add at least 2 pages!
- Make sure you can navigate between all these pages
  - Think in terms of Information Architecture to structure your navigation between these pages
- Include the CSS across the site, make it look uniform
  - Challenge yourself and see what, if any, changes are appropriate on styles between pages.
- Include a Contact Form on one of the pages (it can be a stand-alone page)
- You determine how much more JS to add for now, we'll add more next week.

### Important Followup

- Make notes about which content you have to duplicate across the site
- This will be relevant when we get to React!
