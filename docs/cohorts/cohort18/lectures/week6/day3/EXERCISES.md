## School Exercise, continued

- Extend the [School Exercise](/docs/exercises/fastapi-psql/) to add/update/remove students and classes.

## Build Your Own Database, continued...

- Take the database you built yesterday and add `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes.

## Level Up - Migrations!

- Make another database, but don't migrate the schema manually!
- Create models in FastAPI to match the schema.
- Use Alembic to create the tables via a migration.
- Add/Test some `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` routes.
