title: Week 6 - Backend, SQL, FastAPI
---

We're around the halfway point in the cohort!  This week we are still taking a short break from frontend and JavaScript to continue working with backend development.

This week we'll connect our PSQL databases to our FastAPI code and generate RESTful APIs.  At the end of the week we'll bring our frontend skill back into the picture and connect the full stack.
