## Finish the React Router Tutorial

- Finish the tutorial starting from [Data Writes + HTML Forms](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#data-writes--html-forms)
- Then redo the _entire_ tutorial from the beginning, with a whole new application.

## Let's make a store

This exercise will span a few days, with the goal to level up with each step, and potentially change frameworks!

- It's the revenge of the [ecommerce store](/docs/exercises/react-ecommerce/)
- Now with 100% more React Router, and a different API!
