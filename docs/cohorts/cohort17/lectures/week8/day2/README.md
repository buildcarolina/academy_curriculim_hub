## Do cool things

> "I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things, and none of them bother me. All the mistakes, and all the dopey things, and all the times I was embarrassed — they don't matter. What matters is that I can kind of look back and say: Pretty much any time I got the chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it — and that's where my solace comes from.

## React Router Forms

> React Router emulates HTML Form navigation as the data mutation primitive, according to web development before the JavaScript cambrian explosion. It gives you the UX capabilities of client rendered apps with the simplicity of the "old school" web model.

[...]

> The Form component is a wrapper around a plain HTML form that emulates the browser for client side routing and data mutations. It is not a form validation/state management library like you might be used to in the React ecosystem (for that, we recommend the browser's built in HTML Form Validation and data validation on your backend server).

Translation: Using the React Router `Form` component means that forms are able to work the way forms have worked since the creation of the browser, prior to the advent of Single Page Apps (SPAs). AKA, no more `preventDefault()`.

Which will lead us to...
