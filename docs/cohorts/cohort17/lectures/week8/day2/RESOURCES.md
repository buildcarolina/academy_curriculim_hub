## React, but make it _not_ React

- [How React isn't reactive, and why you shouldn't care](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/how-react-isn-t-reactive-and-why-you-shouldn-t-care-152m)
    <br/>Despite the name, React isn't technically a "reactive" framework.
- [A Hands-on Introduction to Fine-Grained Reactivity](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf)
    <br/>This is an introduction into how "reactive" frameworks work, particularly ones that _are_ reactive that aren't name "React."
- [Letâ€™s learn how modern JavaScript frameworks work by building one](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/12/02/lets-learn-how-modern-javascript-frameworks-work-by-building-one/)
    <br/>This is actually high on my personal list to try out...it's super compelling to dig into the "how" of the tools we're using.

## ENV files

- [Vite ENV and Modes](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)

## Intro to JWT

- [Flavio Copes: JWT](https://flaviocopes.com/jwt/)
- [Okta: A Beginner's Guide to JWT](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/21/beginners-guide-to-jwt)

### JWT + FastAPI

Both of these are almost certainly overkill for our needs, but definitely a good resources overall.

- [JWT Authentication in FastAPI (Comprehensive Guide)](https://dev.to/spaceofmiah/jwt-authentication-in-fastapi-comprehensive-guide--c0p)
- [Adding Database Backed User Authentication to FastAPI](https://www.pedaldrivenprogramming.com/2020/12/adding-real-user-authentication-to-fastapi/)

## Worth a listen

- [Syntax.fm Episode 026: All About Redux and Cookies vs JWT](https://syntax.fm/show/026/all-about-redux-and-and-cookies-vs-jwt)
- [Syntax.fm Episode 510: How to Build an API in 2022](https://syntax.fm/show/510/how-to-build-an-api-in-2022)

## Worth a Read

- [One Thing Better: How to Recover When You Mess Up](https://jasonfeifer.beehiiv.com/p/you-messed-up-now-here-s-how-to-regain-your-confidence)
- [The Subversive Hyperlink](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/)
  <br/>, I'll add this to the "everything old is new again" pile. Back in the "walled garden" internt days ruled by services like Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe, the HTML Link was revolutionary. Now, in the age of Twitter, Facebook, and App Stores, it's interesting to see someone shine the light on the topic again.
- [JavaScript Bloat in 2024](https://tonsky.me/blog/js-bloat/)
  <br/>My hatred of the "Dark Mode" variant of this site is directly proportional to how much I _love_ the message of this site.
