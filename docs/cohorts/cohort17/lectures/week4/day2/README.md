## Hour 1

### Debug

I've got a busted app, and _you_ are going to fix it!

* Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/seanrreid/busted_shopping_DOM/blob/main/README.md)

## Hour 2 -3

Today's topics:

* Intro to JavaScript libraries (aka, "We need to talk about jQuery")
* AJAX

   > JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.
