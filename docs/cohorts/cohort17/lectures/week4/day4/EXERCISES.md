## Music Site

### MASH IT UP!

This repo maintains a list of [publicly available APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).  It's community sourced, and some of the entries may no longer be valid. However, the list is extensive so there are plenty of options.

There's even a specific [section for music](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#music).

Pick an API and find a way to include a _second_ API into your app alongside the work we've done with Discogs.

#### Ideas

* [Lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) can look up lyrics for a song based on the artist and song title
  <br/> The site is free, no registration required. But, the site's primary language is French. So some of the results will contain French words.
* There is a [Bandsintown API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0#/) that can give concert information for a particular band.
  <br/> This one **requires registration (it's free)** to get an API key. There might be a delay for approval before getting the key.

**NOTE**: You don't _need_ to use a music related api, those were just two of the more obvious suggestions. However, if you think of something else that you'd prefer, _go for it!_

### Show us what ya got!

Monday we're going to do a presentation of the current state of your app!
