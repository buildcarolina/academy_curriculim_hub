## Build your site, the continuation

You added more pages, now let's start adding more interactivity.

* Following our in class example, let a user add a list of their favorite artists and/or songs.

### Level Up

Can you include the ability for a user to upvote/downvote a song/artist after it's been added?

**NOTE**: The lists _and_ scores will reset every time a page loads, this is normal and expected.
We'll discuss why this occurrs and how to manage it later.
