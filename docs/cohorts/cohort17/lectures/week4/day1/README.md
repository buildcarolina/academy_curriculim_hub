## Hour 1

### Show'n'Tell'n'Debug

* Show your work from the weekend, group debug any problems, discuss victories large and small.

## Hour 2 -3

(**NOTE**: We'll spend some time setting up some local server tools today!)

* We'll be talking about the event loop, `async` programming, and scope!
* Then we'll do a "to do list" code along.
