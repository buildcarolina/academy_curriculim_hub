:::info
Reminder, we'll start each morning with a stand-up update at 9:00 AM
:::

This is an opportunity to NOT just copy/paste someone else's work, or follow along repeating what I say.

It's an opportunity to make YOUR mark. Write YOUR project, slay YOUR dragons.

Make your project the best expression of YOU, not just a shadow of something else.

> “There was something heavy in me. … I wasn’t doing the right thing. I was just trying to copy exactly everything I had learned. And I think that happens in every craft in life. You’re young. You have a master. You want to emulate them, do what they do. **But at some point in life, you have to turn around and say I have to find my own way in my own language.**”

— Chef Francis Mallmann (emphasis added)

> "Life is not just about peaks and valleys, about wins and losses. Life is about the journey. You hear that all the time. You’ve got to absorb that. You’ve got to know that. The journey has to become the destination because there is no true destination. There is no endpoint. There is no goal. All rivers run to the sea and yet the sea is not full. Life goes on; accept what life gives you. The sun rises the morning after you win the championship or lose in the first round."

  <br/>NOTE: This tutorial uses `apt` to install `pipenv`, that's a Linux based installer (it's like `brew` on a Mac).
  <br/>Those steps won't work on a Macbook or Windows machine.
- [Implementing Supabase Auth in FastAPI](https://phillyharper.medium.com/implementing-supabase-auth-in-fastapi-63d9d8272c7b)

### FastAPI Users

- [FastAPI Users](https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/latest/)
  <br/>This is a library that handles all the User Auth steps.
  <br/>:rotating_light: Note: It will require using Python 3.11 or lower! :rotating_light:
- [Intro Pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)
  <br/>This tool will help you run different versions of Python, i.e. if you wanted to try the above :point_up:
- [Pipenv: A Guide to the New Python Packaging Tool](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/)
  <br/>This is similar to Pyenv :point_up:, but blends `pip` and `venv` in magical ways.
- [My FastAPI Users Demo Repo](https://github.com/seanrreid/fastapi-users-demo)
  <br/>:point_up: is my build following from the [FastAPI Users docs/example](https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/latest/configuration/full-example/)
  <br/>My repo follows more closely with the other FastAPI directory structure we followed in class. _Note_ Look for the **patterns**.

### Supabase

- [freeCodeCamp: Learn Supabase (Firebase Alternative)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7GwCOgvNY)

### Remix JS

- If you want to use RemixJS, check out [this tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial)
  <br/>Spoiler Alert: It looks a _lot_ like the [React Router v6.22.3 Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- There's also a [Blog tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog). It's designed to be quick, they say it's about 15 minutes, but you should recognize other patterns from working with React and React Router.

### React + TDD

- [Test Driven Development in React](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXXnezSEtvNMlfJFd1Z2wilxymcOaVl9Q) is a 9 video series that discusses the topic of Test Driven Development (TDD). I don't require this for projects, and we didn't get to it during the class. _BUT_, it's something you should be aware of.

  If/when you need a break, give one of these videos a watch, each one runs about an hour.
