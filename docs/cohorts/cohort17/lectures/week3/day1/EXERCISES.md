## It's time to make an app!

We're going to start our Music Recommendation app by starting with HTML/CSS. Your assignment for today is twofold

1. [Find a partner](#find-a-partner)
2. [Generate some ideas](#brainstorm-session)

### Find a partner

Throughout this process you'll be working in pairs. So, find someone to work with to start your app process.

You'll brainstorm together to build out the application. We'll essentially be building the same application, but each version will be custom tailored to the decisions you make today.

**NOTE:** We will round-robin this activity, meaning that you will change partners are we go. Ideally, we'll have time for you to finish with the same person you worked with at the start. However, definitely plan on working with different folks for various sections as we progress over the next few weeks.

### Brainstorm session

Start by answering the following questions with your partner:

* Who is your target audience?
  * Who are you building this app for?
  * What are their specific needs and pain points?
* What makes this app standout from existing solutions?
  * Why should users choose your app over another?
* How will users navigate and interact with the app?
  * How will you make sure the interface is intuitive?
  * How will you ensure accessibility for diverse users?
* What are the essential features and functionality?
  * What features should be prioritized initially and what features can come later?
  * What features are _critical_?

### Information Architecture

Once you've answer the above questions, answer the following question (in a Google Doc, Word Doc, or old school pen/paper):

_What is your information hiearchy?_

* What are the most important items to convey to the user?
* How do you remove "friction" (i.e. make it easy for the user to use and/or register to use the app)
* What content is the most important, and how do you make sure it's easy to get to?
* How do you model the site navigation to match this hiearchy?

Bonus:

* What's the ideal user "path" to use the app?
* What happens if (or, realistically, when) the user's don't use the app the way you intended?? ðŸ¤”

### Design it!

Using your answers to the previous questions as a guide, find some design inspiration for your app.

Resources you could try for inspiration:

* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
  <br/>Register for an account to search (it's free) and then enter a search term. You can filter by "web designs"
* [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net/)
  <br/>This site technically sells templates and themes. _DO NOT BUY SOMETHING_! That's going to be overkill. But, it's a great place to find some inspiration.

**NOTE:** You're not likely to find an inspiration that matches _all_ of your goals. The goal is to get something to give you a general direction, _not_ the final product.
