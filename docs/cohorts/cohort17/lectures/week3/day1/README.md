## Cohort 17 Arcade-o-Rama

![Pinky's Arcard in Taylors Mill](./img/pinkys_arcade.jpg)

We'll spend the first hour or so reviewing/playing everyone's Python games!

### Rules

* If your game is working, then the person presenting _after_ you will come up and play your game.
* If the game isn't working, then we'll debug as a group and _then_ the next person up will play.
* After playing a round, the player will present _their_ game, and the next person in line plays.
* The first person to present will play the last person's game.

## Types of programming

1. **Imperative programming** is writing code that tells the computer _how_ to do something.
    > "Hey, Computer, if a user gives you value [x] then perform action [y]."
2. **Decalartive programming** is writing code that tell the computer _what_ you want to see.
    > "Hey, Computer, this content needs to look like this..."

## Random, but relevant, thoughts

> “You’re only as good as you’re willing to be bad…The fact that you’re not going to be good at something or that you’re going to fail at something—that’s OK. Because you’re never going to get good unless you’re willing to be bad.”

-- Randall Stutman PhD, speech communication professor

> I see a lot of people with talent but the one thing they don’t have is that just love of doing it for the sake of it.

—- Rodney Mullen, pro skateboarder
