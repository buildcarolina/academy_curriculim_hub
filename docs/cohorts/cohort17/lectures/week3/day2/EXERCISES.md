## Build your homepage

Take the design you found yesterday and start building!

### Skeleton

* Start with an unstyled page, forget about colors, fonts, etc...
  * Seriously, just make it black text on a plain white background...
* Create a skeleton that matches the hiearchy, use basic HTML elements

### Add Styles

Update the skeleton to reflect the design.

Here's a recommended order:

1. Apply colors
2. Update fonts
3. Add images
