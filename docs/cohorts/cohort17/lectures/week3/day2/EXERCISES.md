## Fun and Games

This is one of my favorite exercises to practice CSS Selectors.

* [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)

If you want to practice some CSS layouts, then frogs, flowers, and zombies can help!

* [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
* [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
* [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/)
   <br/> NOTE: Requires creating an account, but per [updated docs](https://mastery.games/post/flexboxzombies2/) should be free to play.

## Build your homepage

Take the design you found yesterday and start building!

### Skeleton

* Start with an unstyled page, forget about colors, fonts, etc...
  * Seriously, just make it black text on a plain white background...
* Create a skeleton that matches the hiearchy, use basic HTML elements

### Add Styles

Update the skeleton to reflect the design.

Here's a recommended order:

1. Apply colors
2. Update fonts
3. Add images
