## Fun and Games

This is one of my favorite exercises to practice CSS Selectors.

If you want to practice some CSS layouts, then frogs, flowers, and zombies can help!

* [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
* [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/)
   <br/> NOTE: Requires creating an account, but per [updated docs](https://mastery.games/post/flexboxzombies2/) should be free to play.

## Build your homepage, pt 2

### STYLE IT UP!

Update the skeleton to reflect the design using various CSS properties.

#### Start here

Here's a recommended order:

1. Apply colors
2. Update fonts

#### THEN

1. Start with a mobile layout (dev tools!)
2. Do your positioning
    * Default to **small-screen first**, then see how it works on a larger screen!)
3. Add images
4. Keep testing to see how the content "pours" into different screensizes
