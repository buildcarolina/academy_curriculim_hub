## Build your homepage, pt 3

Focus on the following items for Thursday:

* Add an HTML Form to accept some kind of user input
* Create some HTML elements to pass the user input into
* Add some JavaScript to process the form input values
* Take those input values and present them on the screen

## Build your SITE

Starting on Friday, add more pages!

* You decide how much more content to add, but add at least 2 pages!
* Make sure you can navigate between all these pages
  * Think in terms of Information Architecture to structure your navigation between these pages
* Include the CSS across the site, make it look uniform
  * Challenge yourself and see what, if any, changes are appropriate on styles between pages.
* Include a Contact Form on one of the pages (it can be a stand-alone page)
* You determine how much more JS to add for now, we'll add more next week.

### Important Followup

* Make notes about which content you have to duplicate across the site
* This will be relevant when we get to React!
