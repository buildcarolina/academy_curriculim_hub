There aren't any new requirements today. Use the information from the AMA to debug/fix issues that you've encountered.

If you're done fixing issues, then continue to build out the features you want to see.

### Work in small bites!

You won't be able to get _alL_ the features in immediately. In some cases, you won't be able to include a certain feature at all. That's fine, work on what you can include, focusing on the small parts that build the whole app.
