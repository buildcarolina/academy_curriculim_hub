## Potluck

### Retro

We're going to do a [retrospective](/docs/lessons/front-end-foundations/project-management-101/#scrum) on the music app

- We'll be using a [EasyRetro](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/mprhKPu7nQV2hfN3xnhBHsG5hA92/1cb6929c-a3e9-41ab-8bf4-3feddebe33cc) (click the link to the join the retro board)
- We'll follow the [Starfish Retrospective Pattern](https://agileretrospectives.org/en/blog/starfish-exercise) to answer what we should:
  - Keep Doing
  - Do Less Of
  - Do More Of
  - Start Doing
  - Stop Doing
- You'll add any relevant thoughts for the various columns (it's fine if you don't have a thought for a column)
- You can vote for items that resonate with you (1 vote per item per person)

You can read about how EasyRetro recommends [running a retrospective](https://easyretro.io/blog/how-to-run-a-basic-retrospective-using-funretro/).

### Dealer's Choice

Let's group program an interface!

- Let's talk about [Toy Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_program)
- You decide what interactions to code and we'll code it together!

**SPOILER**: Here's the repo for what we did in class -> [Why Not Exercise (aka Dark Mode Toggle)](https://github.com/seanrreid/why_not_exercise)

## Listen

- [Syntax.FM: Potluck: Is Virtual Dom Bad?](https://syntax.fm/show/724/potluck-is-virtual-dom-bad)
    <br/>Yep, I 100% stole the idea of a "potluck" from Syntax. This is a great all around episode and leads well into the next bullet point.
- [Syntax.FM: Is HTMX a Joke?](https://syntax.fm/show/726/is-htmx-a-joke)
    <br/>The primary discussion topic is HTMX, but the broader discussion about _how_ we write JavaScript is ðŸ¤Œ
