## Potluck

### Retro

We're going to do a [retrospective](/docs/lessons/front-end-foundations/project-management-101/#scrum) on the music app

- We'll be using a [EasyRetro](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/mprhKPu7nQV2hfN3xnhBHsG5hA92/1cb6929c-a3e9-41ab-8bf4-3feddebe33cc) (click the link to the join the retro board)
- We'll follow the [Starfish Retrospective Pattern](https://agileretrospectives.org/en/blog/starfish-exercise) to answer what we should:
  - Keep Doing
  - Do Less Of
  - Do More Of
  - Start Doing
  - Stop Doing

### Dealer's Choice

Let's group program an interface!

- Let's talk about [Toy Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_program)
- You decide what interactions to code and we'll code it together!
