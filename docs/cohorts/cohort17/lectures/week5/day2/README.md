## Thoughts on Code Complexity

![Code Complexity](./img/code_complexity.jpg)

## Hour 1

SOMETHING IS BUSTED (again)

* Fork _then_ Clone this repo: [Busted Chuck](https://github.com/seanrreid/busted_chuck_norris)
* Then break into your group fix it!

### Debug Groups

| Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | Group 4 | Group 5 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Cameron | Eddie   | Sean    | Grant   | Kyra    |
| Fields  | Derek   | Jaclyn  | Jonathon| McG     |

The solution is in [this repo](https://github.com/seanrreid/working_chuck_norris)

## Hours 2 - 3

* Upgrading with `async/await`
* Arrow Functions vs "regular" functions
* What is `this`?

## Lessons

* [Handling Browser Events](/docs/lessons/handling-user-input/handling-browser-events/)
* [Callbacks and Anonymous Functions](/docs/lessons/solving-problems-using-code-js/callbacks/)
* [Common JavaScript Patterns](/docs/lessons/solving-problems-using-code-js/common-patterns/)

## Presentations

* [Fetching API Data](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetching-api-data-htwlxf)
* [Arrow Function Syntax](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/jscwm2)

## Food for thought

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
