## CRUDCo JWT + Auth

We're going to keep working on the CRUDCo URL Shortening App.

![It's URL Shortening!](./img/shortening.png)

### Review

* Code Review
  * What worked?
  * Where are you stuck?
* Check our Models
* Verify migrations with `alembic`
* Do some refactoring (Surely you didn't assume things wouldn't change??)
* Test our API to add/update URLs via Swagger

### New Features

* Add in JWT and Authentication
* Test our API to register/login a user via Swagger
* Prepare for some design work on the frontend
