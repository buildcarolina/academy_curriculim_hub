## CRUDCo JWT + Auth

We're going to keep working on the CRUDCo URL Shortening App.

![It's URL Shortening!](./img/shortening.png)

### Review

- Code Review
  - What worked?
  - Where are you stuck?
- Check our Models
- Verify migrations with `alembic`
- Do some refactoring (Surely you didn't assume things wouldn't change??)
- Test our API to add/update URLs via Swagger

### New Features

- Add in JWT and Authentication
- Test our API to register/login a user via Swagger
- Prepare for some design work on the frontend
