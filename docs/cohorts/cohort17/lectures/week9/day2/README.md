We're going to keep working on the CRUDCo URL Shortening App.

![It's More URL Shortening!](./img/shortening2.png)

### Review

- Exercise Review
  - Did you read all the steps _first_?
- Code Review
  - What worked?
  - Where are you stuck?

### New Features

- Add Authentication
  - Review [JWT](https://flaviocopes.com/jwt/)
  - Review [bCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
  - Possibly use [FastAPIUsers](https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/12.1/)?
- Test our API to register/login a user via Swagger
- Work on the client UI

### Eventual Steps

- Let users _actually_ login
- Handle the _actual_ redirection
- Deploy
