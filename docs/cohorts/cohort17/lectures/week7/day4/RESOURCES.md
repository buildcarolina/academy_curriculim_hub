## Helpful Syntax

### Ternary Operators

A ternary is an item that is composed of three parts.

Per MDN:
> The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
