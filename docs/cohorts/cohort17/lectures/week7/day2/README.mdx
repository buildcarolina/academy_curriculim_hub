## Presentations

- [JS Prototypes and Classes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pUhcUx89DHMSSMUbRKobe-kAq4XtC-_8IK-fFRjGIcY/edit?usp=sharing)
  <br/>JavaScript doesn't technically have "classes" the same way a language like Python does. But, what it does have are Prototypes!

## Lessons

:exclamation: Reading this lesson is _strongly_ recommended. :exclamation:

It touches on the differences between Class and Function components, making it much more clear what is going on when you use a hook.
- [React Hooks and Lifecycle Methods](/docs/lessons/react/react-hooks/)

## Discussion

- OOP & Inheritance vs Composition.
- Class syntax vs Functional components (notably [Pure Functions](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure))
- React's Shifts
  - Started with `createClass` (aka, making a Prototype)
  - Then adopted the `Class` keyword (making prototypes that _look_ like Object Oriented Classes)
  - Now, uses function components and Functional Progamming paradigms (with Prototypes still lurking way underneath it all)

## Extra Reading

This article, [All your mainstream UI frameworks are lying to you](https://moonthought.github.io/posts/all-your-mainstream-ui-frameworks-are-lying-to-you/), is fairly interesting.

I don't agree with all of the points the author makes. I also think the author's proposed solution is...not great? But, there are some valid criticisms with regards to the ecosystem of frameworks.

In addtition, there is a fascinating [discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37656257) about the article.
