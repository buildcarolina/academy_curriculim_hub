## General thoughts

> AI will make “how” easy. Knowing “what” and “why” will remain difficult. - [@MDS on X](https://twitter.com/mds/status/1757762934061588885)

## The story so far...

### Where we've been:

- We've learned how to work with variables, functions, and solving problems with code (Python & JavaScript)
- We built Object Oriented Programs with Python
- We've built and styled HTML pages
- We've included external data in HTML via `fetch()` requests
- We've used Python to create our own APIs, and dipped back into OOP just a bit
- We've looked at the Model-View-Controller pattern, and how it, an others, influence server architecture
- We've added content to SQL databases, and used FastAPI to make that content available via an API

### Where we're going:

- It's time to move into frontend frameworks by learning React.
- We'll continue building out our own APIs and working in with Python
- We'll continue working with databases to store data

The next 3 weeks will be the culmination of where we've been. It's putting all the pieces together, backend -> frontend.

Welcome to full-stack web development!

## Getting Started

React has changed quite a bit recently, i.e. a fairly drastic change in the last couple of years.

**Read this first!** -> [Create-React-App Evolution (Bitsrc.io)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-future-of-react-why-create-react-app-is-deprecated-and-hooks-are-the-future-83e8a087a325)
<br/>This documents the recent changes to React, notably that the long-standing `create-react-app` is no longer beings supported.

**Then read this** -> [The Two Reacts](https://overreacted.io/the-two-reacts/)
<br/>React is _actively_ changing and there has been a push towards Server Side Components. This article touches on that thought process.

## Application Architecture

We're moving from simple DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests into _more complex_ DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests. 😉

Notably, we're moving in the realm of "Single Page Applications" aka "SPA."
