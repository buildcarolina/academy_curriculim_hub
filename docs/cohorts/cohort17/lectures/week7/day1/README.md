## Getting Started

React has changed quite a bit recently, i.e. a fairly drastic change in the last couple of years.

**Read this first!** -> [Create-React-App Evolution (Bitsrc.io)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-future-of-react-why-create-react-app-is-deprecated-and-hooks-are-the-future-83e8a087a325)
<br/>This documents the recent changes to React, notably that the long-standing `create-react-app` is no longer beings supported.

**Then read this** -> [The Two Reacts](https://overreacted.io/the-two-reacts/)
<br/>React is _actively_ changing and there has been a push towards Server Side Components. This article touches on that thought process.

## Application Architecture

We're moving from simple DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests into _more complex_ DOM manipulation and `fetch()` requests. ðŸ˜‰

Notably, we're moving in the realm of "Single Page Applications" aka "SPA."
