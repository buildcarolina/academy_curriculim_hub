- Complete the [FastAPI PostgreSQL School Exercise](/docs/exercises/fastapi-psql/)

## Reminder

Remember to use `pyenv` for these exercises!

### Steps to use the command

1. Execute the following command in your project folder to create a directory named `env` containing the virtual environment setup.

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Once activated, the virtual environment's Python interpreter and packages will be used for any Python commands executed in that terminal session.
4. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

This will revert to using the system's default Python environment.
