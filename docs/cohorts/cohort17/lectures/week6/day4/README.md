## School Exercise Code Along

Nothing new today, we'll be adding more soon!

For today, let's debug, review, and extend the [School Exercise](/docs/exercises/fastapi-psql/) from yesterday.

## Comparing CRUD, Routes, and SQL Commands

This table illustrates how a usual CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application corresponds to application routes, and ultimately the SQL statements that might be triggered by those routes.

| CRUD   | ROUTES | SQL    |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CREATE | POST   | INSERT |
| READ   | GET    | SELECT |
| UPDATE | PUT    | UPDATE |
| DELETE | DELETE | DELETE |
