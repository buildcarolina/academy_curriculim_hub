## Warrior Part 2

Continuing from [the work done in part 1](/docs/cohorts/cohort17/lectures/week2/day3/EXERCISES) , update your code to reflect the changes to each class as noted below.

__NOTE__: Doing this work on a new branch and/or new file is recommended!

### Update Characters

### Hero

* Make the hero generate double damage points during an attack with a probabilty of 20%
* Add a `coins` attribute to the `Character` class. Have it default to a value of 20.
* Add a `buy` method to the `Hero` class so that hero objects can purchase items from a virtual store (see below).
  * Give the method an `item` parameter. The item being purchased will be passed as an argument into the method.
  * It should subtract an items cost from the hero object's available `coins`

### Enemies

* Make a character called `Shadow` who has only 1 starting health but will only take damage about once out of every ten times he is attacked.
* Make a `Zombie` character that doesn't die even if their health is below zero.
* Give each enemy a bounty. For example, the prize for defeating the Goblin is 5 coins, for the Shadow it is 6 coins.

### Misc

* Come up with at least two other characters with their individual characteristics, and implement them (i.e. Wizard, Archer, Scribe)

### Go Shopping

### The Store

* Make a `Store` class to make a virtual "shop" within the game where characters can purchase items.
* Add an list called `Items`, this will be a _class variable_. Have it store two items: `Tonic` and `Sword` (see below)
* Add a `do_shopping` method to the `Store` class.
  * Have it display a welcome message and the player's current coin balance.
  * List all available items with their names and costs.
  * The `Hero` class has a `buy` method that will allow a hero object to purchse an item. The cost of the item will be subtracted from the hero object's available coins.

### Store Items

* All items have a `cost` attribute that represents the number of coins the hero will spend.
* All items have a method called `apply` that allows them to be used.
* Make a `Tonic` class that is available via the the `Items` class variable on the store object.
  * The tonic's `apply` method adds 2 to the hero's health
* Add a `Sword` class that is available via the the `Items` class variable on the store object.
  * The sword's `apply` mehtod will add 2 to the hero's power.

### Level 9000

* Create a `Battle` class with a `do_battle` method. Move the game logic into that class. (i.e. asking the user what they want to do, and acting accordingly)
* Allow items to be used on the battle field. The hero can carry the items with them, and you have the option of choosing to use a tonic at any turn in a battle.
* Make a `swap_power` method and add it to a character (or the `Character` class). This method can be used on the battle field to swap the power values of the two characters for one turn.
* There is a bug in the store that allows the hero to buy items even if he has no coins. Fix this bug.

## To quote Fleetwood Mac: You can go your own way!

Using the Warrior RPG as a guide, create a brand new RPG game.

Here are some possible ideas based on previous students' work:

* Murder mystery (ala the game/movie "Clue", or tv show "How to Get Away with Murder")
* Race across the country (ala "Twisted Metal," "Death Race 2000," "Cannonball Run")
* Sports! (literally, football, basketball, baseball, golf)

## Level 10K - PyGame

In the past I've had students use the PyGame framework to generate their own "platformer" games (think old school video games).

Here are a couple links to tutorials that students have found helpful:

* [Kids Can Code: PyGame](https://kidscancode.org/lessons/)
* [PyGame Tutorials (Official Docs)](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials)
* [YouTube: PyGame in 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9VG3Pztok8&t=430s)

## Examples

* [MoonSdg: PyGame](https://github.com/seanrreid/MoonSet)
