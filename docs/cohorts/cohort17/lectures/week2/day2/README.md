## Morning Review

* Review the previous night's work
* Code along with the [previous Level 9000 exercise](/docs/cohorts/cohort17/lectures/week2/day1/EXERCISES#level-9000)

## Continuing with OOP

Today will be a mix of demo + code along. I'm sharing the presentation link again for reference, but most of our information will be pulled from the lesson link.

**NOTE:** It's pets and cars all the way down today! üê∂ üò∫ üèéÔ∏è
