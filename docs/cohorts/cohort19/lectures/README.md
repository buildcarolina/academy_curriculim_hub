## Course Structure

A approximate weekly breakdown is available here: [Weekly Structure](/docs/weekly_schedule)

## Daily Lectures

The daily lectures will be published in weekly folders inside this repository. Each week will contain:

- An overview about what to expect that week, including any recommended preparation
- `day-*` directories - Each day of your class will contain
  - An agenda for the day and any relevant scheduling information
  - `EXERCISES.md` - A link to the exercises for a particular day (could be Learning Portal or external)
  - `RESOURCES.md` - Additional resources that may be relevant to the day's lecture (if applicable)
  - Occasionally we'll include some helpful files here (screenshots, PDFs, etc...)

---

There might be other related files in any given day for extra reading, practice, etc... In general, most will follow the above pattern.
