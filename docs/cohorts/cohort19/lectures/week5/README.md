title: Week 5 - Rain, rain, go away...also, JavaScript and moving towards backend
---

Hey, Helene, we're not friends any more, kthxbye! :wave:

Last week we went into JavaScript, the DOM, asynchronous functions, AJAX, APIs, and all manner of JavaScript.

This (shortened) week we'll try to get back to some kind of normal. We'll continue to work with JavaScript and begin working our way into backend development.
