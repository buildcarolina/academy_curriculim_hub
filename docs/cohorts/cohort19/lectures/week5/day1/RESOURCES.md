## Git & Github Notes

Val made some fantastic notes about the steps for `git` and Github. I'm adding them to the lectures repo!

## HTTP/APIs

- [MDN: CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
  <br/>This is going to come in handy soon!
- [API Design 101: From Basics to Best Practices](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/api-design-101-from-basics-to-best-practices-a0261cdf8886)

## User Interface

- [The Elements of UI Engineering](https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/)
- [Hardware engineers solve a usability problem with the PS/2 connector, but inadvertently create a new one](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210216-00/?p=104869)
  <br/> This is an amusing examination of unintended consequences in User Interface changes.

## Frontend

- [Why Isn't the `<html>` Element 100% Supported on CanIUse.com?](https://anderegg.ca/2024/02/02/why-isnt-the-html-element-100-supported)
  <br/>This isn't something I realized, and the examination of why is really interesting!
- [Why is front-end development so complicated?](https://dev.to/shehzadhussain/why-is-front-end-development-so-complicated-3g8o)

## JavaScript

- [Promises from the Ground Up](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/promises/)
- [Making Sense of "Senseless" JavaScript Features](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/12/making-sense-of-senseless-javascript-features/)
  <br/>This is the article that answers the question: "Why doesn't 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3??"
- [5 Easy Steps To Master Currying and Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-easy-steps-to-master-currying-and-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-85e2a7e2c268)
  <br/>This is a solid introduction to the concept of "Functional Programming." We'll skim the surface of this topic as we progress using React.
- [Why JavaScript is Eating HTML](https://css-tricks.com/why-javascript-is-eating-html/)
  <br/>This will be particularly relevant in a few weeks.
- [Create Element JavaScript: The Power of Dynamic Web Elements](https://log4javascript.org/create-element-javascript/)
- [Making Sense Of “Senseless” JavaScript Features](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/12/making-sense-of-senseless-javascript-features/)

    <br/>This is a repo with fairly thorough notes from someone who took the course.
- [Speeding Up the JavaScript Ecosystem](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/)
  <br/>This is a multipart series about potential improvements across the entire ecosystem. A lot of this will be more advanced than were we are currently, but it's worth a read to judge the scale of JavaScript development today. (it's also somewhat relevent re: Gall's Law above)
- [Modern JS Cheatsheet Repo](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet)
- [How To Use Javascript Arrow Functions & This Keyword](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-use-javascript-arrow-functions-and-this-keyword/)

## CSS

- [Three modern CSS properties your website must have](https://bejamas.io/blog/modern-css-properties-your-website-must-have/)
  <br/>I would argue that "must" is overstated, but these are all really helpful properties all the same!
- [Container Style Queries](https://12daysofweb.dev/2023/container-style-queries/)
  <br/>This has been in in-demand feature since the dawn of Responsive Web Design. It should _finally_ be something we can impliment going forward.
