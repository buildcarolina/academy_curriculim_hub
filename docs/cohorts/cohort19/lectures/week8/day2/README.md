## Do Cool Things

> "I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things, and none of them bother me. All the mistakes, and all the dopey things, and all the times I was embarrassed — they don't matter. What matters is that I can kind of look back and say: Pretty much any time I got the chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it — and that's where my solace comes from.

## CrudCo Continued...

Today we'll work with React Router's [`loader` pattern](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/loader) and [`action` pattern](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/action).

- [Demystifying Loaders and Actions in React Router 6 (Part 1)](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/demystifying-loaders-actions-react-router-6-part-1) has a solid breakdown of using these patterns and how they work.
<br/>There are some code examples with that breakdown, they primarily use TypeScript.  You don't need to do that as a code along, but it's helpful to see TypeScript at work.
