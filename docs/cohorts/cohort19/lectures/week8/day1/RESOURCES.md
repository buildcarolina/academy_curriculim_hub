- :headphones: [How to Pick a JavaScript Framework](https://syntax.fm/show/835/how-to-pick-a-javascript-framework)
  <br/>I hadn't thought of things in the way that Scott frames them, but I honestly think he's spot on:
  > [...] I am going to take the stance that I don't believe a framework is a framework without auth and a database, or at least some sort of solution for that. For me, everything else is just kind of like a pre-framework. It is a a tool to build things, [...] I wouldn't consider NextJS or SvelteKit even a framework. Granted you can build websites, but, with those tools, you're always having to tack on 10 additional choices of your own. To me a framework is something more like Rails or Django, or any of these things that do more of it for you.

  <br/>The author discusses the consistency of long-term good work vs. spikes of great work. I'm inclined to agree with the assessment.
