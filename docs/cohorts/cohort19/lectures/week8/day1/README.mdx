## Hour 2

### Welcome to CrudCo!

We are CrudCo, and we've been hired to build out an eCommerce site for a client.
<br/>We're going to work in reverse for this exercise. We'll start with the new-to-us items on the frontend _then_ we'll build out the API.

- To get started, we We'll use the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as our backend.
- After building out the frontend, we'll build our own API that follows the same schema as FakeStore.
