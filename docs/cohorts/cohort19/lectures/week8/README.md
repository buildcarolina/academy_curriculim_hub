## Welcome to CRUDCo

There won't be as many resources/exercises this week. Our primary focus for the week will be building out a feature complete full-stack app. We're going to act like we're an agency and have been tasked to build an ecommerce app for a client.

Welcome to CRUDCo, Inc! Let's build rad stuff!
