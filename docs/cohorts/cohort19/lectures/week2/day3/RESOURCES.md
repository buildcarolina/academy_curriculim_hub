## Videos

The following are videos from my friend Azam Sharp. Azam is a former co-worker of mine, an excellent instructor, and a prolific video producer. I'm sharing a couple videos that I think are relevant for your current experience solving problems with code.

- [Azam Sharp: Writing Clean Code - Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3PiBx9jO88)
  <br/>This tutorial is using the Swift programming language, but the principles he's covering apply to programming in general.
- [Azam Sharp: Git Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc1L-TQjZZY&list=PLDMXqpbtInQiSpxYyd8AxmJCVE7equijT&index=1)
  <br/>This is a playlist of videos that cover all things `git` and Github. Some of it is review, and there are a few new things as well.
