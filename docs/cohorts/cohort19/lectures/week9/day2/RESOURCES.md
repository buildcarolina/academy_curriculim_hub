## General

- [Learn Things That Don't Change](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/learn-things-that-dont-change)
- [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)
  <br/>There is a _lot_ of good food for thought here. Personally, I think "lines of code" is a meaningless metric, regardless of whether there are few or many.
- [How To Get a Web Developer Job in 2024 (without dying inside) üßë‚ÄçüíªüíÄ](https://dev.to/wasp/how-to-get-a-web-developer-job-in-2024-without-dying-inside-eo8)
- [How Senior Software Engineers Document Their Project](https://dev.to/koladev/how-senior-software-engineers-document-their-project-1nf4)
  <br/>I'll own up to the fact that my documentation is lacking...this looks like a solid approach?
- [On Good Software Engineers](https://candost.blog/on-good-software-engineers/)
- [Say No to `console.log`!](https://dev.to/alishgiri/say-no-to-consolelog-556n)
  <br/>The title is a bit clickbaity, but it is helpful to know some of the other types of `console` messages.

## Test Driven Development

- [Learn TDD: React](https://learntdd.in/react)
  <br/>We'll be reviewing this soon!
- [YouTube: Test Driven Development in React](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXXnezSEtvNMlfJFd1Z2wilxymcOaVl9Q)
  <br/>This is a few years old now, so it won't reflect recent changes to React. However, the principles still apply!

## JavaScript

- [JavaScript Best Practices 2024](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2024/10/javascript-best-practices-2024/)
  <br/>Jetbrains makes some _really_ good code editors/IDEs, so I think the advice here is sound.

## HTML

- [HTML Form Validation is heavily underused](https://expressionstatement.com/html-form-validation-is-heavily-underused)
  <br/>This article is spot on! The browser has come a long way, you can get a lot accomplished if you use the tools you have available. Many of them are often more powerful than you realize!

## FastAPI

- [List of FastAPI Boilerplate repos](https://github.com/topics/fastapi-boilerplate)
  <br/>There are 90 repos on Github that match the terms "FastAPI Boilerplate," ranked by stars (meaning, popularity).
  <br/>:rotating_light: You won't find something that's exactly 1-to-1 with what we've done in class. :rotating_light:
  <br/>The goal isn't to find an exact match, but to learn from other processes!
- [Minimal async FastAPI + PostgreSQL template](https://github.com/rafsaf/minimal-fastapi-postgres-template)
  <br/>This is an example from the list above, it's well documented and the folder structure follows patterns that are similar to those used by Django.

## bCrypt

- [Easy Password Hashing Using bCrypt in Python](https://geekpython.medium.com/easy-password-hashing-using-bcrypt-in-python-3a706a26e4bf)

## Alembic

If you populated your databased _before_ using `alembic` you likely ran into some issues trying to perform migrations.

[This article](https://medium.com/@cemdurak/alembic-existing-db-a4cf36a33c77) walks through an approach to "adopt" an existing database. It might be the option you need if you're not in a position to start over with a clean database.
