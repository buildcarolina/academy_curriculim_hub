## General

- [A Brief History of Airbnb’s Architecture](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/a-brief-history-of-airbnbs-architecture?r=1g0l&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)
  <br/>This is a great historical look at how AirBnb was built when it launched, and how it scaled as it grew.

  <br/>I'm not sure if I completely agree with this take, but I also don't think the author is off base.

### Side Effects/useEffect

  <br/>
  > When we modify something, in JavaScript, we cause side effects, this simply means modifying or changing our code, causing it to have unpredictable behavior and mutability.
- [useEffect Hook – Reactjs](https://www.tothenew.com/blog/useeffect-hook-reactjs/)
  <br/>
  > The useEffect hook is a boon for the functional components. It basically allows us to execute side effects in our functional components. Side effects here are referring to api calls to the backend server, interacting with browser APIs[...]

### Hooks

- [Flavio Copes:How to use the useCallback React hook](https://flaviocopes.com/react-hook-usecallback/)
- [Flavio Copes: How to use the useMemo React hook](https://flaviocopes.com/react-hook-usememo/)

  <br/>
  > In most use cases, your application won't be affected if a function is re-created and gets a new object reference upon each render. Even so, it can be tempting to proactively wrap a function in a useCallback to improve app performance. However, this premature optimisation can actually do harm rather than doing good.
