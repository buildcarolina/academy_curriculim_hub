## General

- [The End of Front-End Development](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/)

## HTTP

- [HTML "self-awareness" with sibling indexing in JavaScript](https://dev.to/cassidoo/html-self-awareness-with-sibling-indexing-in-javascript-2p94)
  <br/>This is almost more of a thought experiment than a practical application. BUT, it's a really interesting experiment in building with _just_ JavaScript + HTML

## Fetch

### _Go Make Things_ on `xhr` vs `fetch`
