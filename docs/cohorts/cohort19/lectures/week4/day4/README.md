## Morning Review

- We'll set aside some time to review last night's exercises.
- Then we'll have one final, relatively quick, round with Chuck Norris.

## JS is Weird

- [_JS is Weird_: The JavaScript Quiz You'll Love to Hate](https://jsisweird.com/)
- Answers from our quiz are here -> [JS Is Weird Answers](./JS_is_weird_answers.pdf)

### Reference

- [WTF JavaScript Repo](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs?tab=readme-ov-file#what-the-fck-javascript)
  <br/>This is a collection of things people find odd in JavaScript, including explanations for **why** things are that way (many of which made up the _JS is Weird_ quiz!).

## In Class

We'll start the [JavaScript OMDB Movie Lookup](/docs/exercises/js-movie-review/) app as a group.

This will be your task for the weekend. :clapper:
