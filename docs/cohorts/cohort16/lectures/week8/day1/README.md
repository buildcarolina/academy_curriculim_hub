## Django Notes

Per the documentation:

> Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

Read [the overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/overview/) to get a deeper insight into what Django offers.

### ⭐⭐ READ THIS FIRST! ⭐⭐

* [MDN: Django Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction)

### From the Django Docs

> Django is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt), a jazz manouche guitarist from the 1930s to early 1950s. To this day, he’s considered one of the best guitarists of all time.

This FAQ article explains the Djangon perspective on MVC vs MVT: [Django appears to be a MVC framework, but you call the Controller the “view”, and the View the “template”.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names)

## Motivational Help

From the [October 15th edition of Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/october-15-2023/)

### Hard Mode vs Easy Mode, You Decide

> Your position determines if you're playing on easy mode or hard more.
>
> Many people unintentionally choose to play on hard mode by not sleeping enough, not eating healthy food, or not investing in their most important relationships.
>
> You can't remove struggle or emotion from life, but you can put yourself in a position where they don't control you.
>
> Consistently doing the simplest things makes the biggest difference.

### Consistency >>>> Talent

> Talent and potential mean nothing if you can't consistently do the boring things when you don't feel like doing them.
